"The most important thing is to enjoy your life-to be happy. It's all that matters" 3


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

In which, she finds herself in a new place that seemed on the edge of the world+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

𝓣he sun seeped downwards on the frowning brunette, who solemnly stood watching as her hyperactive mother and gruff step dad packed up their dull silver car with almost all of her belongings, as well as her tranquil older sisters, Bella Swan.115

At first, she seemed extremely ecstatic when her sister thought it was a good idea for them to go live with their dad for a while in Forks--a town so secluded it seemed to be on the edge of the world, far away from reality-- so their mother could travel with their step dad for his Baseball career, but at the time she didn't realise how much she would miss her mother and her home, here in Arizona.10

"Oh come on, Riley. This will be good for you" her mother promised her as she held the girl's rosy cheeks in her gentle palms, smiling down at her lightly to try and cheer her mood up to what it was a few days prior, but the girl only put on a façade for her mothers sake.8

"I know mom, I'll be fine, it will just take a while to get used to" She waved it off as though it was nothing, but the truth was that she didn't want to hurt her mothers feelings by admitting that she didn't want any of them to go.6

Her mother aged lips frowned slightly before she started leaning forward to press a soft and nurturing kiss to her youngest daughters forehead, before pulling away and slowly lowering her hands to her sides, even though it pained her to do it.+

"Bella, promise you'll take care of each other" Her mother had turned around to her eldest daughter-who was stood holding a cactus that she planned to keep alive whether they were on a plane or not-and smiled at her, before holding on gently to her hands.39

"Always" Bella replies in her usual awkward and quiet tone, she slowly pulled her hands away from her mothers gentle touch and shuffled away towards her younger sister, placing the cactus on top of her bag that sat in one of the back seats on her way over.12

Bella Swan, Riley's older sister, was an extremely awkward and clumsy girl, she was more of the stay-at-home-and-read-a-book type than she would go out for a walk or something simple and non-sociable. She liked purple, gold and dark blue to express herself on her curtains.8

Riley, on the other hand, was more shy at first but once you got to know her, you'd would gladly lay your life before her so she'd be happy, she had a vibrant feeling that seemed to lighten even the darkest of hearts around her, and her parents and Bella tried their best to hide her from the trouble in the world so she could keep her innocence. She had more of a pastel colour palette that she wasn't afraid to show off in her clothes, although that might need to change now she was moving to the damp Forks.60

                                                                              •·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

"Come on, Bell" Riley gestured for her older sister to move along in the busy airport that they were currently cramped in, Bella quickly grabbed her younger sisters hand so she could keep her close by in the stampede. +

Between the two of them, if a stranger came up to talk or ask them a question, none of them would be able to answer because of their traits when it comes to random strangers.+

Riley held onto Bella tightly, as she didn't want it get lost or be separated from her, as they were in an airport with thousands of people scurrying around, and all chattering to each other or on the phone, it made her anxious.+

Bella was like Riley's safeguard, if she was sad she went to Bella, if someone's was mean, Bella would actually tell them off, and everyone knew not to mess with little swan unless you wanted the wrath of Bella Swan.134

"Okay, we should be on this terminal" Bella said out loud to her shy sister, who glanced over her shoulder to check the signs in front of them. "We can give them our tickets and passports to look over now and then we'll be able to go through, we don't have to talk to them"21

Riley nodded at Bella's explanation before they went through to the stand, where two women were checking over peoples information.+

"Next" the blonde said and the sisters stepped forward, Bella went first before she stepped away from the air and towards the door that led into the plane.+

Riley stepped forward shyly and handed over her slips and passport, the woman quickly checked over them before glancing up at the girl with a smile. "Enjoy the flight"3

"You too" Riley muttered but then but her lip as she realised that the women wasn't getting into the plane, she scrambled up her items as she cast her head down and walked towards Bella, who seemed concerned for her sisters sudden red face.122

"Let's go in" Bella gripped Riley's hand again and began to lead her down the hallway type thing and into the actual plane where the flight attendants greeted them and asked if they needed any help finding their seats. "We're seats, C-21 and C-22"5

"The letters are on the cabinets, c is over there" One of the attendants pointed over to a window seat and Riley's eyes widened before she was tugged away from them.+

"Window seat!" Riley dibbed before she dived into the seat, placing her bag onto her lap and jittering in her seat slightly as the nerves hit her and she didn't know how she was actually feeling.24

Bella places her bag into the cabinet above them before holding her hand out to Riley, Riley handed over the bag so it was put away.+

Bella shut the cabinet before she sat down next to her hyper sister, who was glancing around outside the window, watching all the other planes around the place and the passengers inside.1

"Fasten your seatbelt" Bella instructed her softly, and Riley nodded quickly before she tried to clip herself in, but struggled to her annoyance. "Here"5

Bella leaned over and held onto one of the straps and loosened it easily so Riley could easily clip herself in, before she pulled away and smiled at her sister.+

"Don't forget to hold my hand" Riley reminded Bella, sure she loved the view and the plane ride, but she hated the lift off and landing, in her experience it was the worst time of the entires flight.68

Bella resisted the urge to roll her eyes but instead nodded slightly before turning straight and sighing in her place.27


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley let out a sigh as they walked out from security with all their items still with them, their bags had just been checked (again) and their passports were observed closely, as if they couldn't see the same person, maybe it was because Riley was grinning.28

And now they had just gotten their suitcases which were placed on a cart-like thing that they could push to the their dads cruiser, which would most likely be parked near the front.+

"I thought we'd never escape!" Riley let out dramatically as the two walked together whilst pushing the cart, Bella smiled at her sister's sudden excitement, glad that they and each other during this experience.+

"You know what, me too" She admitted, "and what was up with that guy who was hiding something under his coat? I thought it was going to be something bad..."+

"Nope" Riley grinned as she spotted their father stood next to his car, "it was just his food, he didn't want to throw it away or something....DAD!"4

Riley ran full force at Charlie, who chuckled as he caught her in his arms, the two shared a hug before they pulled away and looked at the awkward teenager behind them.29

"Hi, Charlie" Bella waves awkwardly, and Riley pouted before she decided she should start unpacking the bags into the trunk.25

Riley marches over to the cart and dragged it to besides the back of the car, where she lifted up the trunk and began to lift the bags and place them inside.+

"Hold on, I'll help" Charlie quickly offered as he saw his daughter attempting to pack away the items into the trunk, before he walked over and started to unload them all into the car. "These are heavy, you must be getting stronger Riley"1

Riley just giggled at him with a playful eye roll before they both continued to place the items inside, after they finished Riley decided to go in the back of the car, where there was less awkwardness.20

Truth be told, Bella definitely took after their father when it came to social interaction, he had no idea what to do in any situations other than football, fishing and fooling around with Billy Black.13

"Seatbelt" Bella reminded Riley, who groaned lightly before she doubled checked it for her sisters sanity. "Good"13

"Calm down, Bells. You act like I'm going to disappear into things air all of a sudden" Riley joked, and Bella sent her a look that Riley knew all to well.48

Bella didn't like it when Riley ever brought up her leaving, or disappearing or even being hurt, even though half of the time it would be a catchphrase, like 'I would rather die'.+

"You've grown out your hair since I've last seen you" Charlie states on she had glanced at Bella, who was connecting hands with Riley through the gap on the sides. 2

Bella lifted her other hand to her hair as she observed it slightly, "I've cut it since you last saw me"2

"I guess it grew out again" Charlie excused himself slightly awkwardly as he didn't know how to reply, and Bella dropped the pieces of hair she was holding as Riley face palmed.+

They had somehow managed to make this situation more awkward.+

"So, any good library's or sight seeings?" Riley spike up to break the tension in the cruiser, Bella has given up and was now watching the outside world through the window, which displayed a ton of rain.+

"Yeah, I'll, erm, I'll show you at some point" Charlie stumbled on his words, "you still like your writing and photography?"6

"Yep, I brought some of my best lenses here with me" Riley smiled, "I haven't been doing much writing though, haven't had much inspiration, kinda hit a slump"33

"I'm sure you'll find something soon enough" Charlie reassured her, and the car went back to silence as Riley chewed on the inside of her cheek as she fiddled with Bella's fingers.8

It was certainly not the most comfortable place currently.+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•5

Riley stumbled into her old room with one of her suitcases in her hands, She glanced around her old bedroom at the yellow walls and instantly cringed at her hyper-childish self, she was obsessed with the colour when she was younger but it seemed to look more like a neon to her now.21

She hummed as she balanced her suitcase on her bed, she was considering painting the walls a pastel yellow instead, to soften out the walls a bit, they seemed a little too extra at the moment.3

"Everything okay in here?" Charlie awkwardly asked from the doorway as he caught sight of his daughter glancing around the room, she turned to him with a wide smile.+

"It's perfect, just thinking about changing the wall colour though, and it will need a bit of a tidy up" She began to list everything she needed to do, "so you need help with the rest of the stuff?"+

Charlie waved her off politely, "I'll bring em up, you unpack and get comfortable"+

He started to shuffle out of the room without expecting another word, but Riley replied with a "thanks, Dad!"3

When he glanced back he saw her forcing her suitcase open with a grin as she began to unpack her belongings, he shook his head before leaving the room, just happy to have his daughters back.16

The current suitcase on Riley's Queen sized bed was filled to the brim with all of her decorations, her other two suitcases were the actual clothes and shoes, but she had a full suitcase of things that was usually around her room.2

Including her favourite blanket, she had knitted it with her old friend Jacob Black's mother (Sarah) before she had passed away, so it was extremely important to her.+

She placed down the blanket at the end of the bed before turning to the rest of her items, instantly picking up the photo frames, which she had wrapped carefully, to place on display.+

Unpacking the rest was just as easy, even when her father would knock on with another bag that he had found in the car, Riley was almost certain that some of hers and Bella's belongings were probably mixed up, especially because their mother helped backed the bags and she wasn't usually the best organiser.+

"Riley?!" Her dad shouted, and she closed her wardrobe with an eyebrow raised, he was shouting her from downstairs, which was usual considering how quiet he usually was. At least he didn't sound angry or anything.+

She trotted down the stairs with confusion and outside the front door that was wide open, and frowned once she saw a bright orange truck on their driveway, she couldn't help but think about the truck screaming for a paint job-exactly like her wall.+

So, she added it to her to-do list.+

Bella was sat inside of the truck, rummaging around the control's and all the different storage places, as a random kid sat next to her that she couldn't seem to make out their features.+

"Riley!" Billy Black, an old friend in a familiar wheelchair greeted her, and Riley slightly squealed before she ran over to give him a big bear hug.+

"How are you Billy?" She asked once she had pulled away, noticing the teenager next to her, who creeped up and pulled her into a hug. "Jake! Did you actually grow?!"16

"Riley! Did you-oh wait, never mind" He cheekily states as he pulls away from her with a smirk playing in his lips, Riley scoffs before she swats his arm, to which he doesn't react to other than a small laugh.5

"I missed you guys! Oh! We're going to have so many movie days!" She planned ahead as her eyes brightened up at all the fun she thought they could have together, Jake just laughed at her excited manner as his Dad began to run over Charlie's feet again.9


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

"Oh God, I can't do this" Riley panted as she gripped onto her chair, not wanting to jump out of the car and face the new dangers, "I can't, Bella, I can't"11

Bella frowned over at her younger sister, "hey, I'll be with you every step of the way"2

"We're in different years" Riley deepened, giving her elder sister a pointed look as she just gripped the seat tighter.5

Bella shook her head quickly, "you forget it's not like Phoenix, they join different years for some of the classes"14

Riley's eyes widened, "there will be older students in my classes?? Oh god, now I'm definitely never getting out!"5

Bella sighed gently before she jumped out of the truck with her bag and quickly moved to the other side of it, forcing Riley's door open before she peeled Riley's hands away from the chair and unclipped her from the seat.+

"I'm sure you can walk the rest of the way, you can even hold onto my hand if you like, or my arm?" Bella offered, trying to make her sister more comfortable with the situation, even though she hated it.10

"Don't be so dramatic, I'll carry you if I have to" Their cousin, Athena said as she got out of her own car, scowling at the sight of all the other students.55

Unlike Bella and Riley, Athena was tanned with blonde hair, sure she had brown eyes but that's where the similarity's stopped, even her personality was opposite theirs and she was often seen as a bitch, but those close to her knew she valued family and wisdom.36

Athena, who gave up, reaches forward and threw Riley's bag at Bella, who caught it with difficulty.+

She then stepped forward and held her hand out to Riley, who slowly grabbed it before letting her cousin lead her towards the school, eventually grabbing her bag from Bella so she could grab her sisters arms too.+

"Listen, I know how to get through the school, so you guys are solid" Athena promised the two, before she walked them up the steps and glanced around slightly. "Watch out for a dude named Eric, he'll try to drag you into stuff"2

Riley nodded as she listened closely to every word Athena was saying, as she was the smartest of the three, her name was literally named after the Greek Goddess of wisdom.+

Athena watches as Eric stepped forward with a huge smile on his face, and immediately ducked away towards the building, leaving her cousins to deal with him alone.15

Riley glanced over at Athena's body in confusion before a strange teenager stepped forward in front of them with a welcoming smile, she let out a silent squeal before holding onto Bella closer.2

"You're Riley and Isabella Swan, the new girls. Hi, I'm Eric, the eyes and ears of this place. Anything you need. Tour guide, lunch date, shoulder to cry on" To be extra, he even leaned towards them as he tugged on his sleeve with a smile.+

"I'm kind of the 'suffer in silence' type" Bella quickly states, slightly mumbling as she's quiet and Riley thought that he didn't hear her for a second.+

"Good headline for your feature-I'm on the baby, and you're news, baby, front page." Riley shrivelled up her nose at that, it sounded gross being called baby by him, maybe it was the way he said it, but it made her even more  uncomfortable .4

"I-no, I'm not news-I'm seriously, not at all-" Bella stumbles on her words as she didn't know what to say, as Riley slightly peeked over her shoulder at the 'conversation'.+

"Whoa, chillax, no feature" +

This dude was definitely creepy and unsettling, Riley finally decided and she swore that she heard someone snicker from nearby but she ignored it.54

Riley blanked out the rest as the conversation, she found her self gazing around the place as people watched the two Swan girls enter the school and travel around, being led by a talkative Eric.+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Riley finally let out a huff as she found her first classroom of the day, Freaking English, the best lesson to have on a Monday morning, she just hoped they were doing creative writing.17

She entered the classroom as people were still finding their seat or sitting down, she was relieved at that because it meant not having a whole class watching her as she entered.+

"Ms. Swan?" A woman asked softly and Riley's eyes drifted over to her, she nodded silently. "My names Miss. Fannon, I'll be your English teacher for this year, today we'll be starting with creative writing, if you're familiar with it?"11

Riley smiles at that, and nodded quickly, of course she was familiar with it, she was often known for her writing between lessons.1

"Alright, how about you sit...over there! With Ms.Cullen, can you raise your hand please?" Her English teacher gave her elbow a quick squeeze before she walked over to where a student had their hand up.7

Riley turned around to see a blonde Goddess peaking at her boredly, Riley gulped as she thought that she didn't like her already, so she gripped her bag closer and let out a shaky breathe before shyly walking over to her seat.57

She took out her book and glanced around, seeing people either talking or beginning their story's, she didn't know if there was a specific topic or not, but she certainly did not want to disrupt the girl next to her.+

"The key word is 'angel'" the girl muttered next to her, Riley's eyes widened as she heard the melodic voice, she slowly turned to the girl next to her-who was turned back to her own work-before she smiled slightly.21

"Thank you" She said wholeheartedly before she picked up one of her favourite pens, slowly placing it to her paper so she could begin a story on the word 'angel'.7

Riley and Athena walked into History as polar opposites. +

Riley was practically bouncing from the walls, to the ceiling, to anywhere else. She was so exited to learn about anything to do with the past, she was always so intrigued by everything that would be/was uncovered.3

On the other hand, Athena was gripping her coffee for dear life, she had only just been moved to History as there was a mix up when she first started at this school around a few weeks ago, because her father was always travelling.2

"Isn't this exciting?!" Riley questioned Athena as she bounced in, slightly walking on her toes as she went, Athena grumbled begins her.+

"Coffee first, then I can acknowledge your emotions" She states before she patted Riley's head, causing her mood to deflate slightly.6

"Boo" Riley pouted before she stuck her tongue out, before she turned around and spotted the other people on her classroom, causing her to retreat into her shell as she watched the busy people shuffling around and sitting down.22

Athena gently grabbed Riley with her free hand before she tugged her along to the back, "sit down next to that Jasper kid, okay? I'm right next to you.."16

Riley nodded slightly before she sat down in her newly assigned seat, she noticed how the guy next to her was sat against the wall, trying to get himself further away from the class, she could definitely relate to that.+

She let out a shaky breathe before she took out her pencil case and a notebook, so that she was ready to learn.+

Glancing over at Athena, she could tell that her cousin was annoyed with the tall brunette who was staring at her with an unfamiliar emotion.+

That, certainly did not help with her nerves.+

"Alright class, lets begin with a few questions about the civil war" The teacher began the lesson and Riley was relieved that it was a subject she already knew. "Okay, how about...ms. Swan, can you tell us when the civil war was?"32

Riley froze in her spit as she began to panic, she could feel that people were waiting on her answer, she as just waiting on the words as well.+

As though it was an angel, she felt a wave of calmness wash over her and her muscles relaxed before she calmly answered, "12 April 1861 - 9 April 1865"109

"Correct" The teacher smiled, before she moved onto someone else, causing Riley to let out a breathe she didn't even know she was holding.+

She glanced over to the boy besides her, and was shocked to see that he was looking at her, he gave her a small smile before turning back to the lesson, which she shortly followed.32

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Riley walked along with Athena, who was punching her fists into the air out of pure anger, spitting on every word she spoke.+

"And the nerve he had to continue staring?! Even though I questioned him?!" Athena grumbled, setting out another two swings, Riley carefully dodging one as it came her way, she settled her hand on her cousins shoulder, who calmed down before gently pushing it off. "Okay, ok. I'm calm" 6

Riley grinned at her before they met up with Bella, who seemed to be in a dismal mood too, wether it was anger or sadness, Riley didn't know.+

"Do I stink?" Bella quickly asked when she took notice of her relatives who would stood in fork for her expectantly.15

"Always" Athena cracked a joke, before Riley realised Bella was being serious, so she sent Athena a 'quiet!' Look.+

"No, Bells. You smell perfectly fine, you even used my vanilla perfume today" Riley reassures her the best way she could, nobody could say the vanilla spray stunk, it was heavenly. "Why?"19

"Nothing, it's nothing" Bella dismisses, and Riley frowns at her secrecy before she decides to nod it off.+

Riley turns to Athena and gives her a quick hug before jumping into the passenger seat of the seat, Bella shortly following to her own seat so they can drive off.+

Whilst Charlie took Bella out to eat, Riley decided that she was more comfortable staying at home so she could get her new homework done quicker.+

Charlie only agreed because his daughter seemed so passionate about completing it early, and because she was one of two swans that could actually cook in the family, sucks to be Charlie and Athena.+

Riley was sat down at her desk, carefully scribbling away an essay about Macbeth, which happened to be one of her favourite plays written by Shakespeare, she absolutely despised Romeo and Juliet.78

She was trying to answer the question for the homework, on how the witches were evil and if they made Macbeth who he was.6

Something tumbled over onto the floor in another room, causing a huge slam onto the ground, Riley flinched before her eyes widened and she reached over for her tennis racket.13

For some reason, her mother thought it was a good idea to get her into tennis when she was only eight years old, obviously that was over now but she still had a neat swing.+

She slowly walked towards Bella's room, as it seemed to be the source of the noise, and slowly turned the handle before entering.+

Only to find nothing, she scoffed when she saw the window wide open, it must've been the wind pushing the curtains or something.20

She marched forward to where one of Bella's novels was on the floor, she carefully picked it up before placing it back onto the book pile on the old wooden desk.+

Riley let out a sigh as she glanced around the room, she was pretty much sure that Forks was driving her out of her own mind, she walked forward and slammed Bella's window down glancing over to where the woods were before groaning and turning to leave the room.3

She had a Macbeth was ya to write after all.1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            8

After the phone call from their mother, Bella has her mind set on confronting Edward Cullen, she even waited by the truck to see if he would pull up with his family, but he never showed.+

Bella made sure to keep an eye out for him every single day that he wasn't there, and she took notice of how strange his disappearance was.+

Riley was more concerned about her sisters wellbeing, after all she didn't know the guy in the slightest.+

Riley let out a small giggle when Bella fell onto her ass because of the ice, she couldn't help it, even if she tried to fight it.5

Charlie rushes forward to help her up quickly, "you all right?"+

"Yeah, I'm good" Bella let out as she finally stood a table again, Riley reaches forward and linked her arm with Bella's, trying to balance it out. "I've doesn't really help being uncoordinated"+

"Yeah" Charlie agreed as Riley pulled away from Bella and moved towards the passengers seat. "That's why I had some new tires put in the truck, old ones were getting pretty bald"3

Riley smiled over at her father, he seemed to be really trying to let the girls feel at home here.+

"Well, probably be late for dinner. I gotta head down to Mason County" Their dad states, and Riley's eyes widen, Charlie missing food? "Security guard still the Grisham Mill got killed by some kind of animal." +

"An animal?" Bella repeated in confusion as she watched their dad walk forwards to his own car, it seemed unusual to the both of them.+

"You're not in Phoenix anymore, Bells." He stated and Riley frowned, "anyway, I figured I'd lend a hand."+

"Be careful" The two swan daughters spike in unison, Riley more worried than her sister.+

"Always am" is how Charlie responded, and Riley glances over to her sister to see her take on this, but she seemed to be in her usual mask.+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Riley tugged her coat closer as though to try and keep herself away from everybody, she hated crowds and her sister was currently in a different class, while she had a free period.+

She had decided to go to the library, as it would be secluded and quiet, meaning she could go inside and do as she wished, within reason that is...+

When she arrived at the library she felt more at home with herself, it seemed to be radiating with all the different shelves and books, kit forgetting about how there was an actual fireplace, which was kind of boarded up so nobody could step near it.+

But, it was perfect, for her at least.4

She slumped down in one of the seats, at a small wooden table in the corner, before she decided to place down her things and shake off her jacket.+

She wandered around the shelves for something she liked, although her favourite books were mainly on her bookshelves back at her mom's house, but there was no harm in looking around.+

"Quileute Legends" She spoke as her hand shifted down the spine of one of the books, she picked up the blue and battered book before she looked down at it with a frown.14

She swore that Sarah used to read these stories to her, but this didn't seem like a fairytale novel, it seemed as though it was full on facts, it was even in the 'history' isle.5

Riley took the book with her to the nice and old librarian, who smiled once she realised there was a student in there.+

"How can I help you dear?" She asked, a dirk etching onto her face as she looked down at the book int the students hand.+

"I-I was wandering if I could take this book home? I don't know if it's the same as Phoenix..." Riley tried to explain calmly, and the woman laughed her off before gesturing for her to hand over the book.+

"This isn't one of the library's" the librarian quickly said, as she analyses the book, she handed it back to Riley and sent her a wink. "But, since the owner left it, there's no harm in you borrowing it"22

Riley nodded before she held the book closely to her and waved the librarian goodbye, her Math class should be starting soon and she wouldn't want to be late to that.+

So, she ran over to her things and forced her new book into her bag before she ran out of the library with all her things, just in time for the bell to ring.+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Bella walked over slowly to where her sister was sat inside the trucks trunk, happily reading away with her Macbeth novel.2

"Hi, Bells. Was today any better?" She greeted her sister with a kind smile, as she tucked her book away into her bag, placed it into her shoulders before she jumped out of the trunk.+

"I guess so" Bella muttered before she glanced over to the other side of the car park, Riley tried to follow her gaze, but too many people stood in the way.+

Bella turned and placed one of her ear phones in, so she could listened to some music and listen to Riley at the same time.+

"I found, the library today! It was amazing! You have to visit it some time, there was so many books in there that Phoenix wish it had!" Riley saunters on, not mentioning the book the was currently in her bag, it was kinda personal to her as it reminded her of Sarah. "Is that an onion?"+

Before Bella could answer the question, Tyler's can came spinning around the corner without any control whatsoever.+

Athena quickly rushed over to the Swans, running as fast as she could the them so she could drag them away, she pulled Riley behind the Fiery orange truck and hoped that Bella was safe as she held Riley close to her body.5

There was a loud bang and then people were suddenly running over to the truck, shouting the Swan's names.+

"I'm so sorry, girls, I tried to-" Tyler was apologising as Athena helped Riley over to where Bella was, making sure she wasn't near the people.23

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Athena and Riley were sat down together holding hands, more for Riley's sake than anything else, they were currently in the waiting room for Bella.+

Charlie has already arrived and it's the girls that he'd check up on her, but that didn't settle Riley's nerves.+

The girls then heard harsh whispers and Athena looked over to see some of the Cullens arguing outside of Carlisle's office.+

But, Riley paid no attention as her eyes were in the door that lead to where Bella was.+

"Hey, Bella is the clumsiest person we know" Athena tried to help Riley as she shook and squeezed her hand. "Remember when she fell off the ladder? And then the stairs?"20

Riley let out a small laugh, she could still picture it to this day, Bella trying to reach something up high and then from that day on their mother has banned her from using ladders for all eternity.+

"How many stitches did she get in her leg again?" Athena asked with a small laugh. +

"Twenty-eight" Riley recalled, "she also had to wear that hot pink cast on her left arm for six weeks, because mom picked out the colour"14

"She hated it" Athena added on with a huge laugh, causing Riley to join in before they were disrupted by Charlie and Bella coming through the door.1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

Today was the field trip, and Athena made it her personal job to be Riley's caretaker for the day, as she seemed Bella had forgotten to do the job for herself.18

They were waiting over by Athena's car when Athena let out a grumble, causing Riley to raise her eyebrows at her as she lowered her book. "What's up?"+

"He's staring again" Athena mumbles to her, hoping nobody else heard, she seemed to be agitated again, which was a usual sign of when her stalker was watching.+

Riley glances over to where Emmett was stood with Rosalie and Thomas, but his attention was fully on Athena as though he was afraid to look away from her, like something terrible would happen if he did and he'd hated the thought of it.52

"He looks like he's about to take a bullet for me any second" Riley grimaced at Athena's bluntness, but the girl was unfazed by herself as she drank away some more Coffee. "When is this stupid school going to let us on the bus? I want a nap"6

"And I've got a new book to read" Riley smiled as she held up her new blue book she had found the other day in the library, she held it with pride and curiosity which was her usual when she found a book that interested her.+

"Quileute legends" Athena read out the title of the book that was in front of her, she swore that she felt more eyes on the pair of them. "What kind of none sense is that?"+

"It's not none sense" Riley rolled her eyes lightly at the lack of imagination that her cousin held "they're little story's that Sarah used to read to me, and I happen to find them intriguing"+

"No big words" Athena whines, "not at this time in the morning"3

"It's nine a.m. and intriguing isn't a big word" But Riley's comment was cut off by her cousin groaning again, "Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia"99

Athena grabbed her head as though it had physically hurt her to head the word that left her intelligent cousins lips, "what the hell does that even mean?!"4

"It's the phobia for big words" Riley grinned at her cousin, who rolled her eyes in annoyance, before chugging down some more coffee.17

"Come on, I think we're getting on now"+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

The teacher was droning on about all the biological properties of the place that they were in, and Athena was drinking her second cup of coffee from another flask she brought, as her cousins walked together in front of her.+

"Don't drink it!" The teacher exclaimed and jumped forward to take the compost tea away from Tyler.+

Athena snorted from behind the Swan siblings, Bella walking straight on as she ignored everything other than Edward, and Riley biting her lip as she looked up from her book.5

"What's in Jacksonville?" Edward questions as Bella and Riley try to walk past him, the girls stopping awkwardly.2

"Oh, erm.." Riley tried to think of something, but realised he was asking Bella, or at least she thought that since he was stalking her like a hawk.1

Athena let out a huff at the group before reaching forwards and dragging Riley away from the awkward scene, making Riley secretly owe her for the saving.+

"Thank you" Riley breathes out as they were out of ear shot, Athena nodded in return. "You seem better, is the tub of coffee kicking in?"+

"Shut up!" Athens hissed playfully as she swatted Riley's arm "it was not a tub, it was like...three or four cups! You're just being dramatic"9

"I was exaggerating" Riley corrected Athena, who groaned again in return. "And you had like, four sugars in each coffee, I swear you should have diabetes"25

"Anyways, why do you think Sir Pale's a lot  over there is questioning my dear cousin and your sister about?" Athens brought you the question as the girls glanced over at the talking pair, which seemed like a whole other awkward dimension.+

"He asked about what's in Jacksonville" Riley added, "Probably overhead Bella talking about visiting mom"+

Athena shrugged in agreement and then that was the end of that conversation, "so hows the mystery book?"+

"The legends are really intriguing" Riley answered honestly, feeling insecure about being watched again, she held the blue covered book close to her chest as if she was expecting it to be ripped away from her. "Remind me to tell you about them some time"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley was boredly sat next to her cousin as Athena was collecting random herbs, Athena had banned Riley from bringing any sort of book with her so she had to sit there and watch.+

Her sister, Bella, had gone off to the La Push beach with a few friends which had ultimately led to Athena and Riley to refuse to tag along with them.+

Leaving them to Athena's garden, where she was collecting herbs from random plants, per her boredoms request.3

Something about it just seemed to calm her nerves.+

"You know, in the olden days they would've thought you were a witch from collecting all these herbs, especially because if you don't cook or wash these properly, they can inflict quite a lot of damage" Riley spoke from her 'grounding' step as she held a light blue umbrella over her head to help with the rain.6

Her foot were covered with thick layered socks and ladybug themed welly's, her blue raincoat was twice the size of her but it seemed to fit the strange theme she had going on.4

Athena was walking around with just leggings and t-shirt, claiming to have loved the rain, even proving it as she did a small twirl when they first exited the house.+

"Don't you feel weird that we both live near a dark forest that were forbidden to go in to because of all the dangerous animals, I mean logically why would they even place houses next to it?" Riley questioned as her fist held onto the umbrella tighter, she wasn't exactly built for the cold even if she did find it pretty.12

"Just think about all the cute or fascinating things that are in there, instead of all the rare dangerous ones" Athena shrugged it off as she ripped the roots off of an unlabelled herb, "that should be the..."+

Riley tuned her out and instead focused on the tapping on top of her umbrella, she closed her eyes and listened to the soft patterns.+

"The damn garlic hasn't done yet, I'd give it another two weeks.."8

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

Riley was disrupted whilst reading as her dark oak door was forced wide open, bouncing off the wall as her elder sister walked in with an unknown expression on her face.+

"The book about those myths...where did you get it?" Bella questioned, her eyes glancing to the blue book that sat on a desk close to a dream catcher that Riley made with Jacob when they were little.+

"The library, but I found a store that sells it" Riley offered, just praying that Bella wouldn't Ask to see hers, Riley had stuck in a bunch of sticky notes where she either corrected the book or she wrote down her theories and thoughts on it, she had noted down how the book was sometimes different from the original stories that Sarah had told her.+

"Great, can you give me a name? Or like, an address?" Bella asked as she wafted her hands around awkwardly, her curiosity cooling down to reveal her true nature again.+

"Sure, I actually have it written down on a piece of paper.." Riley explained as she jumped up from her seat by the window and grabbed a pink slip of paper that rested on her desk, she handed it over to her sister who smiled.+

"Thanks Riley, and can you not tell anyone that I asked you about this?" Bella's request had confused Riley but she nodded nonetheless, not knowing the consequence of what would happen if she refused. "Thank you"+

And with that, Bella went off to do her vampire research while Riley buried the thoughts that had come across her mind.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I am going to rip her to shreds when I find her pale ass" Athena grumbled as she walked back and forth in the the living room, Riley crouched on her feet as she binned all the beers her father had drank the previous night because Bella had left them.6

Bella's words were printed on them both and now there was a familiar silence upon the house, one the family members hadn't felt since the first member of the family had walked out on them.+

'You may be smart Riley, but you don't function like a normal person, you can't possibly understand anything I'm going through!"24

"Help me understand then, Bells!"+

"I've tried too long to put up with your childish fantasies"6

"Oh, and don't forget what I'm going to do with that Justin Timberlake wannabe, he's going to be paler than his freaking father when I'm done with him" Athena continued her walking, Riley sniffling again as she placed another beer can into the bag. "No, let me do that"16

Athena practically threw herself to the ground and grabbed the bin bag from Riley, who just nodded slightly as her cousin took over cleaning the living room.+

Riley sunk back against the chair and decided to stare forward as Athena continued to mumble about all the ways she'd hurt Edward once she had her hands on him.1

Then, there was footsteps racing down the stairs and the pair looked over to a distraught looking Charlie swab, who had his phone in one hand and his car keys in the other.6

"We need to go"+

•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•☾ ♡ ☽•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•·•+

When they had arrived to the hospital in Phoenix, chalice was racing to the desk with Riley as Athena was scanning around the area.8

"You little bitch!" Athena cursed out loud as she spotted a few of the Cullen's sat in the waiting area, her eyes mainly drawn to Edward as she gained all of their attentions.4

Edward stood up and met her gaze, glancing over to the worried sister and father momentarily before turning back to the raging woman. "Athena-"+

Athena had swung her fist to his stomach, causing him to let out a groan and hold onto his stomach, someone stifled a laugh in the background.31

She blew a piece of her hair away from her face before readying her fist for another go, "good, that's a start-"1

Riley had grabbed her hand so she couldn't hit him anymore and forced her cousin to meet her demanding eyes, "not now Athena, we're here for Bella"+

Athena let out a small huff as she glanced at the boy clenching his stomach, before she pouted and took a seat opposite the staring stalker that she hates so much.+

"Thank you, Riley" Edward's chilly voice spoke and goosebumps rose on her arms and legs, but she crossed her arms and shook her head at him.+

"I hope you know that you'll never be excepted into this family, and that if you mess up again, I won't be the one holding Athena back...it would have to be he police and I don't think my dad would even try" Riley quickly stated, before she hummed slightly and wandered over to the seat next to Athena, who sat with her head down.9

"Maybe next time, you should just...let me get him?" Athena questioned with a small shrug in her shoulders, as she refused to meet eyes with the boy who sat opposite then.+

"Next time" Riley agreed and Athena let out a small cheer, before sending a glare in the staring boys direction, hoping to fend him off. "God, I'm tired"+

Athena grumbled something before she took off her coat and hung it over her petite cousin, before forcing her head into her shoulder, Riley thanked her before she snuggled closer and closed her eyes.+

Charlie walked over to the pair and looked softly at them, he smiled at Athena, who gave a small smile back before she rested her head on top of Riley's.10


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley had woken up before Athena, she lifted her head from her cousins shoulder and the coat slipped from her shoulders and down to her waist as she groggily looked around.1

The cullens were still here, apart from Edward who seemed to be missing, but other than that there was-+

"Mom?" Riley questioned in her tired voice, seeing her mom sat next to her father.+

Her mom shot you from her seat and walked over to her second daughter, "hey Riles, you can go see you're sister now, we were waiting on you"+

"Why didn't you wake me up sooner?" Riley questioned, showing she was now wide awake as she shot up from her place, Athena wiggled next to her before she groaned.+

"Hey aunt Renee" Athena waved as she covered her mouth with her other hand to yawn, "I need coffee, as soon as possible please"+

Renee let out a laugh as she observed her niece, who was walking up slowly but seemed to be in a foul mood, the complete opposite than the hyper girl next to her who was bouncing in her seat as she was waiting.+

"Here you girls go!" A cheery voice called out, and the swans looked up to the pixie-like girl who held out a tray to them, the tray displaying food and a cup of coffee.3

Athena quickly snatched the coffee and took a quick sip, "yes, that hits the spot"+

Riley grabbed the full tray to hold and gave Alice a smile with a small thank you as she placed the tray on a coffee table near them, she grabbed a slice of toast and began to nibble on it.+

"Why is that young man staring at you?" Rene leaned towards Athena as she spoke, and Athena groaned frantically before sending Emmett a glare, causing him to smile at her attempts.11

"Thanks for the food and drinks Alice" Riley changed the subject as she smiled at the brunette who was chatting lively to her boyfriend, who seemed confused as to what she was going on about, but he smiled at her passion. +

Alice turned to Riley with a kind smile as she waved her off playfully, "any time"+

Riley smiled back before she brushed the crumbs off of her body and stood up, looking at her parents expectingly. "Can I go see her now?"+

"Of course, Riles, let's go" Her mother offered with a gentle face, holding her hand out to the girl, who grabbed it before she was pulled along gently towards Bella's room. "The Cullens said they'd head back soon, and we'll follow after Bella is discharged...I believe that Edward wants to stay here with Bella....I think that we'll send Athena back with The Cullens"3

"Athena will not enjoy that" Riley hummed as before they arrived at the room, her mother gesturing for her to go into the room, which she did so.+

Riley walked in slowly and the door closed behind her, she realised that Edward was asleep on the chair next to Bella, holding her hand. +

She lifted her phone up and took a picture for future reference, wishing she had brought her camera so that the lighting would be better.1

"Riles?" Bella mumbled slightly as she heard the clicking sound, and Riley grinned at her sister before she walked over slowly. "Hey, I missed you"+

"I missed you too" Riley frowned lightly as she looked over all the needles, she was never good with family members in hospitals, or even needles in general. "You broke your promise..."+

"Which one" Bella joked lightly, and Edward almost stiffened as he heard Bella's loose side with her sister.7

Riley let out a small and airy laugh, before she sat down in a seat available. "Not ending up in hospital, not making me see a needle again...and us sticking together. And that's on the top of my head"+

"Sorry, I won't do it ever again" Bella promised as she reached over and grabbed her sisters hand.5

"Bella, whenever you feel overwhelmed you should tell me, I'll go anywhere with you. As long as we're together"14


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            23

Bella Swan had decided to go to prom after all, well, more like forced by Alice Cullen and her very own sister.+

Alice and Riley finally met properly and the two immediately fawned over each other's fashion taste, before they joined together and planned out Bella's look for prom.+

Athena had been given an invitation to the prom, but she had decided to not go and had instead insisted that she'd come over to the Swan residence after Bella and Edward had left to go to the room, not wanting any reminders of the cringe night.3

Which leaded on to current times where Bella was sat in front of Riley's vanity as the younger sister curled her sisters hair gently, being extremely patient with the difficult hair.+

The walls had yet to be painted a lighter colour since Riley and never really caught on to her to-do list, having been so busy with catching up with high school work and a social life that wasn't the most social.+

"I'm nervous" Bella admitted to her sister, who let out a soft smile before she nodded slightly.+

"It would be weird if you weren't, technically this is your first proper date with Edward...or any boy for that matter" Her sister chatted on lightly, and Bella just nodded along awkwardly, her anxiety increasing. "But it's no reason to be nervous, Edward will be there for you and you know he would gladly drag you away to somewhere private"+

Bella nodded in agreement before she smiled at her sister, "you're right, I'm being ridiculous"+

"Exactly" Riley agreed, before she turned off the curling iron and placed it down on its protector that lay on the vanity, and she spun Bella around slowly and hummed. "We need to make a few changes to make this more you..."+

Riley ran over to her boxes under the bed and pulled out the one with head accessories, before she let out a cheer and ran over to her sister, placing the headband on and nodding slightly. +

"Thank you, it's perfect" Bella thanked her sister as she continued to sit down, and Riley tilted her head again.+

"Oh! How about my white cardigan and those trainers you like" Riley offered, not even taking an answer as she was already running over to her wardrobe and taking it out.+

Soon enough, Riley announced to Edward and her dad that Bella was ready, running downstairs with a big grin on her face, that Edward returned as it felt contagious.+

"Come on down Bella" Riley encouraged her sister, who soon began to walk down slowly, and Riley took in Edwards awe-struck face, feeling her heart soften at the sight of their love.+

Charlie shuffled awkwardly with his feet as his daughter reached the bottom and too Edward's arm, it didn't seem natural for any of this.+

"May I take some pictures?" Riley quizzed as she held up her camera, and Bella rolled her eyes playfully before nodding. "Okay, just pose...how ever I guess, you guys look perfect together anyways"1

She snapped a couple shots before she let out a small cheer as she found her favourite one, "I'll print it off and give you both a copy later, for now...you should get going!"+

Edward me out a small chuckle at the girls excitement before he began to steer Bella towards the door, wanting to help her with every step of the way.+

"Have fun!" Riley shouted from the doorway, as herself and her father watched the young couple get into the car.+

"But not too much fun!" Charlie added on, giving Edward his best glare that had Riley shiver slightly before she began to shove her father away from the couple.+

"Leave them alone!" Riley wanted as she pushed her father back in the house, closing the door behind her.+

In which, She meets his eyes and the world shifts65


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Bella Swan hated a few things, like crowds, unnecessary confrontation, attention being on her...but most of all she hated the idea of ageing, she didn't like the choice of dying, or having to leave anybody else behind as she passed away.+

She didn't like the idea of leaving Riley, her parents and now...Edward.+

But, every year on the dot Riley arrived in her room with her favourite breakfast and a birthday present, and Bella never argued as she knew how much Riley valued birthdays.+

"Happy birthday!" Riley announced herself as she walked in with Bella's favourite breakfast, one of her best meals she could make. "Here's your breakfast in bed, and I admit that I had needed Edward to drop off the ingredients...but, here you are"+

Bella took it with a sheepish grin before she took the utensils and almost moaned at the taste, she had taught her sister how to cook amazingly. 6

"The gifts are as big as usual...but here you go" Riley handed over a medium size box and a smaller box, and Bella took them with a thankful grin before she unwrapped them.+

One was a photo album of most of the photos Riley and taken of them together, or with friends and family, and towards the end their was even a section with pages of photos of her with Edward. +

Riley blushed when her sister sent her a look, "you guys are so photogenic, I couldn't help myself half of the time..."8

Bella just nodded as she closed the book after a brief observation, before she opened the smaller box with a wary look.+

"It's a charmed bracelet, where I can keep giving you charms for it." Riley explained shortly, before rambling on. "I bought the one with the cactus that says 'always' on it, and Edward bought the apple one...even though I don't know what it means, he seemed to think it had a deep meaning towards it...I'm blabbering, oh sorry..."18

Bella just let out a small laugh before she wrapped it around her wrist gently and nodded, "perfect"+

Riley let out a big grin before she jumped over to the food to give her sister a hug, that Bella immediately returned for a few minutes before she pulled away with a slight gasp.+

"We need to get ready, or we'll be late" Bella explained herself quickly, and Riley almost laughed as she realised she was still in her cupcake pyjamas.+

"Athena would not forgive us" Riley countered, and the sisters nodded together before they set off in their own ways, Riley returning to her room so she could get dressed for the day, while Bella gingerly got out of bed with a groan and checked over her head in the mirror, hoping not to see a grey hair on her.+

Riley decided on an oversized hoodie tucked into a pair of light jeans, knowing that it was a more folder day of the year in Forks. 3

After getting dressed for the day, Riley ran downstairs quickly and grabbed her bag that Bella had prepared her lunch in the night before.+

Riley ran outside and over to hug Edward, as she seemed to be in a great mood this day. Edward returned the hug with a small chuckle before he placed her down on the floor gently  and met her eyes as if they were sharing a secret. "Did she get the bracelet"27

Riley grinned cheekily, her dimples showing slightly. "Yes, and she loved it!"+

Edward returned the smile with another before he noticed the girls shivering, "you can get in the car, I have the heating on for you already"24


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I don't get why you're setting up a huge meal and everything, I mean, she hates her birthday with a burning passion. Besides, she's already late" Athena chatted on while she sat on top of a counter, opposite the one that Riley was setting up Bella's cake on, her dad had began to get worried and had tried to call the Cullen's household multiple times to find his daughters whereabouts. "I mean, she's two hours late and food it cold now"+

Riley frowned as she stopped placing the candles in the cake, and she let out a sigh before she spun around to her cousin, her brain working away slowly. "You're right, it's just...she hasn't been the same since she came back from her birthday with the Cullen's and I wanted to make it so she had a good memory about her birthday, even if it's a few days later..."+

Athena's features softened and she went to reply, only to be stopped by a distraught looking Charlie who stood in the kitchen doorway with a grin expression. "It's official Riles, nobody knows where Bella is"5

Riley's head began to pound unexpectedly as many different scenarios came to mind, Athena and her father seemed to be talking hastily about what to do, and Riley suddenly snapped.1

"Called Billy and see if he has any guys that can go out in the Rez to look for her, call any help you can get at work...I think I might know a place she could've gone" She had instructed all of them, "Athena, can you go and knock on a the Cullen's house? See if anybody was there?"4


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            4

When Riley had admitted that she knew a place, she hadn't exactly told them that it happened to be the Woods near the school, as she knew they'd freak out about the idea of her going into the woods alone and in the dark.+

Riley tugged lightly on her jumper as she held her torch up high, recognising the place from Bella's stories about her time with Edward.4

They had officially started dating in the woods after they 'shared their deepest secrets' or whatever Bella had said, Riley had practically sat on the urge to ask about if it was if they were the 'cold ones'.+

But, Bella still told her about the places Edward had taken her, most of them being in the woods which had practically screamed on Riley's head, but she wasn't dead or anything...she couldn't be...+

She heard a twig snap and her breathing increased as she spun around in the direction it had come from, only to be left with nothing but some animal paw prints in the mud.6

She turned her head back to the path that she had been walking down and continued her hike in the dark, "Bella?!"+

A whimper suddenly filled her ears and she gasped as she caught sight of her older sister curled up at the branch of a tree, seeming to be crying and whispering a sentence over and over again 'he left me'.+

"Oh, Bells" Riley sighed as she crashed down to the floor next to her, Bella immediately wrapping her arms around the girl for warmth and comfort, but Riley didn't hold much more warmth since she had been walking around for about an hour, having underestimated her knowledge of the woods. "Someone will be here soon, and then we'll get you home and safe...I promise..."+

But Bella didn't pay attention to that, she just continued a silent weep into her sisters shoulders as she continued on with her constant phrase.+

There was a few more snaps of some swigs, and Riley flinched slightly before she stood up and made sure to stand in front of Bella, who grabbed ahold of the girls hand weakly, her grip seeming to slip lightly. "Who's there?!"+

Riley held up her torch as a weapon, shining it in different areas as the snapping only seemed to close in on them and her heart beating irrationally at all the possibilities that could happen. +

"Calm down!" A voice called out softly, even though it seemed to be quite rough, and a shirtless man walked out with his hands high to show he means no harm. "I'm Sam Uley, Billy sent me and my friends out to look for Bella"+

Riley sighed, her body shuddering as she lowered her torch and turned back to her sister on the floor. "Bella, he's here to help"+

"I'll grab her" Sam offered as he walked over, picking up her body easily. "Paul, help Riley"30

Riley snapped her head over to where another figure was, who actually seemed rather annoyed to be in the situation, which caused Riley to shrink under his gaze, and she didn't meet his eyes as she shook her head at Sam's order. "I-I'll walk"16

The rest of the trek took less time than it had taken her to get to Bella in the first place, and Riley sighed of relief when they had reached the border of the woods near their house.+

Police cars, friends and family were all surrounded around the front of the house, seeming to be talking about Bella's whereabouts.+

"Bella!" Charlie suddenly shouted as he spotted his eldest daughter in Sam Uley's arms, emerging from the woods. "Riley! Oh thank God!"+

Charlie ran forward to grab her, along with Jacob and Athena who checked over the girl before they turned to the younger one who was shivering almost as much as her sister.+

"You idiot!" Athena hissed lightly, before she dragged her cousin into her arms and hugged her closely. "I almost had a heart attack"+

"I'm okay, a little cold...but it was worth it because I found Bella" Riley's chattering teeth let out a bright smile, and Athena's features softened before she shook her head.+

"Here, take my jacket and we'll go inside to warm you up" Jacob offered, taking of his jacket that surrounded the petite girls entire figure, and he bit his lip to hold in a smile.+

"One second" Riley held a finger up at Jacob and Athena, before turning around to where Sam and Paul were stood talking to Billy, more Sam than Paul. "Sam"+

The male's head snapped over to the small girl in recognition, Billy nodding his head as Sam gave him a small glance to silently ask if it was the 'Riley' who Billy had told him about.3

When Riley reached them, she let out a huge smile that almost had Sam in a puddle. "I just wanted to say thank you, for finding Bella and I in the woods"20

"No problem"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Months seemed to pass by and Bella hardly ever talked to anyone (unless you counted Riley, who Bella seemed to fake a positive attitude around, just so the younger girl wasn't effected) but the girl always heard the screams at night, it shook the house and her own dreams.14

The bags under Riley's eyes seemed to be bigger than the hours that the screams seemed to play, Riley and no idea what Edward had done to Bella, but she knew that it had to be horrific due to the screeching that thundered the neighbourhood every night, Riley had recently picked up on coffee, the drink that she once took as dull and too dark for her, was now her one and only savour from the lack and sleep.2

That and the sleepovers that Riley would have at the Black's residence every Saturday evening, where they would snack and watch movies before Riley would end up sleeping early on.4

Not that Jacob minded, nor did Billy. In fact, they welcomed her with open arms, as they knew the troubles that the Swan's were currently facing and they knew the impact that it seemed to have on both Riley and Charlie...not forgetting the inevitable look of a constant reaping that seemed to settle on Bella's face.+

What looked quiet and tried was actually a storm bigger than anybody else understood.+

"Okay, so turn it clockwise until you hear a slight cooking sound and then you can stop" Jacob explained to Riley as they worked on his new car, that she wanted to help with since she had already completed all her homework for that week.+

"Alright" Riley nodded slightly, turned the tool-that name she had forgotten already-around slowly clockwise until their was a random clicking noise, and she pulled the tool away quickly and looked over to Jacob hesitantly.+

"Yeah, that's right, you did it" Jacob encouraged Riley, and a smile soon settled on her face, which Jacob returned before he grabbed the tool from her hands gently, and he chucked it into the box. "Now, pizza or burgers? Cause I was thinking we could go to this dinner"8

"Let's try that!" Riley agreed, tipping onto her toes lightly before a frown came onto her face. "Do you have a jumper I could borrow? I didn't know we'd be going out"+

Jacob scoffed playfully as the pair began to walk into the house again, away from the garage. "I'll be wanting it back, alongside the other ten you stole"2

"Don't be so dramatic Jake" Riley waved him off as they walked into his room, that had been cleaned when Riley arrived earlier, since he was a messy person. "I only have Seven, well, now I have eight"4

Jacob threw her a playful look before pulling his drawer open and passing over a black jumper that her had, claiming that it went best with the jeans she was wearing.8

"You should stop hanging around with Quil and Embry, you sound like a girl" Riley commented, and Jacob laughed her off before he closed the drawer and stood the girls wrist.+

"Alright, bike or car?" +

"Car, obviously the car" Riley quickly let out, her eyes widened as she panic inwardly. "I am not getting on that death machine Jacob!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            6

"Ow!" Jacob hissed after the girl hit him again, the pair had arrived to the dinner after what seemed like a long trip, Riley had been holding onto his waist so tightly that they both thought she'd break something. +

"You idiot!" Riley smacked his arm again, Jacob barely flinching away from her. "I told you I didn't want to!"+

"Yes, but we're here so..." Jacob tried to excuse himself, before he saw two people entering the dinner and he scowled to himself, and Riley tilted her head at him innocently. "It's Sam Uley and Paul Lahote, the gang I told you about, where they take steroids"2

Riley frowned to herself as they both approached the footed themselves, Jacob opening the door for her to go through first. "Why would they do that?"+

"I don't know, but I don't like the way that they look at Embry" Jacob shook his head, his glare settling on the three guys at the counter, and he realised that Jared Cameron, was also here. "Just, stay away from them, whatever you do. Okay?"2

"They helped Bella" Riley countered, letting Jacob tug her hand over to the other side of the dinner. "They didn't have to do that, but they did"+

"Whatever, let's just not speak about them" Jacob shook his head, no longer wanting to talk about the gang. "Anyway, I believe it's my turn to pick the movie for tonight"+

"Oh no"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Okay, so, if I win..I get the last portion of popcorn, if not, then you get it" Athena explained as she sat on the couch next to Embry, Quil and Jacob had already placed a bet on who they thought would win the battle for popcorn.+

"Deal" Embry agreed as he sent her a slight glare, and they both held their hands out before wrapping their fingers around each other's, their thumbs in the air.+

"One, two, three, four...I declare a thumb war!" Riley chanted as she played referee, seeming as Jacob and Quil would use the position to their advantage so they could win a stupid bet.14

Quil began to shoot at Embry when the boy was struggling, Jacob laughing at the fact that Athena seemed to be winning, Riley just watched their thumbs closely until Athena's ended up on top. +

Quil groaned as he handed Jacob ten dollars, Jacob wearing a huge grin on his face as Athena began to walk over to the last portion, a laugh etching her face as she began to sing about it, only causing Embry to sulk even more.+

"What the hell Embry! You've had a massive growth spurt and you're full of muscles! How the heck did you let her beat you!" Quil grumbled you the loser, Riley sending the boy a  sympathetic smile as she took her original place next to Jacob, who wrapped his arm around her shoulders in a friendly manor.+

Over the past few months as Bella had basically dropped everyone in her life, save for Riley on the few times where she needed a comforting company, Jacob had seemed to take Riley under his wing as her new best friend.1

Their relationship was extremely platonic and nobody ever questioned its nature or anything, as they knew that they would never date.18

"I got movie tonight" Riley reminded as she snuggled into the boy further, Jacob groaning slightly as he knew it would most likely be a chic flick, seeing as Athena never watched them with Riley, Jacob was sacrificed. "I was thinking 'My Girl' but apparently it's really sad, so, grab your pillows and ice cream"20

"I don't cry" Jacob disagreed stubbornly, Embry and Athena rolling their eyes as they knew he was lying, whereas Quil just nodded along silently.1

"You cried at freaky Friday" Riley furrowed her eyebrows at the boy, tilting her head so she could meet his eyes.2

"Yeah! Because it was beautiful how they mended their relationship in the end!" Jacob defended, his cheeks turning pink as he realised he only made the situation worse for himself, Athena began cackling as she finally shared some of her popcorn with Embry, where they watched the two best friends argue over crying.+

"It's okay Jacob, you have a feminine side" Riley smiled gently, "ooh! I brought my face masks that you like, and the moisturiser!"6

Jacob his his blushing face in Riley's hair as the others began to laugh again, Riley's eyebrows furrowing in confusion as they continued their laughter at Jacobs state, what was wrong with him liking face masks and girly movies? 3

"Go away" Jacob groaned at the strange group of friends, waving his arms at them, embarrassed enough at the situation.2

But, they only seemed to laugh harder at him as Riley continued her confused face.+

"Does that mean I shouldn't tell them about how you do my hair?" Riley quizzed, Athena beginning to choke as she heard that sentence. "Whatever you guys, at least Jacob it relationship worthy, Quil took his cousin to prom!"21

Then, the attention went from Jacob to Quil, who looked sheepish under the laughter, which caused Riley to apologise to him multiple times as Jacob only seemed to thank her.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Bella?" Riley had to do a double take when she spotted her sister inside Jake's garage, before her eyes shift even further to the motorcycles that Jacob seemed to be looking over. "Bikes?!"+

Riley's tone squeaked as she recognised the death machines, bad memories coming back to her as a shiver seemed to pass down her spine and to her very soul.+

"Why are there bikes?" Riley questioned the pair, and Jake let out a sigh as Bella went to open her mouth up as an excuse. "Oh my God, Jessica was right! You've become an adrenaline junkie"+

"Where did you hear that?" Bella furrowed her eyebrows at the familiar sentence that Jessica had spit out to her when they had went to the movies and Bella got into that strangers bike.+

Riley scoffed at Jessica's constant drama, "she practically painted it on the walls, everyone thinks you've gone mad, and here you are with...those...death machines"+

"It wasn't the bad!" Jake defended against Riley, who sent him a small glare, he had traumatised her when she had first gotten on the a bike.2

"You won't tell anyone will you? I promise I'll be safe! Jake will be with me every time I'm even near them" Bella started to ramble on, trying to make sure her sister wouldn't call her out to their father, and Riley knew that if she told her dad, Bella would be on the first flight back to Phoenix.+

"Fine, Bells" Riley finally sighed, cutting Bella off from her sentence. "But Jake has to be there with you, and you have to be safe"+

"Yes, of course, thank you"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            3

Riley had decided to have a break from Bella and Jacob's sudden fascination with each other, deciding to go to her cousins instead since she knew the girl would most likely be tending to the herbs and plants in her garden, seeing as it seemed to be a growing hobby.+

"I just felt like I was intruding there, and I have been going there for months, it was my second home and I somehow felt like I was the one out of place" Riley frowned as she explained the situation to Athena, who would nod every so often so Riley knew she was listening.5

"Seems to me that Jake has a crush on Bella, and she seems to be relishing in the attention, not forgetting about how he is literally doing up a bike for her...for free" Athena expressed her thoughts and Riley's eyes widened slightly.+

"It just...it just isn't Bella, not the Bella I know anyway. Edward broke her and now I don't know how is best to help" Riley stated sadly, watching her cousin pull a purple plant out with a slightly straining sound, Athena checking that the roots were still on and smiling when they were. "What are you doing with all this anyway?"+

"My mother's mom had left behind a bunch of journals about these weird recipes and stuff, half of it is a bunch of mumbo jumbo, but most of them work...like the one for headaches, sleep, tiredness, pain and so on...I shrink she was a herbalist of some sort" Athena explained quickly and Riley's eyes widened before she took out the book about the legends.18

She flipped through the pages until she found the story about the third wife and a 'helper' who had enchanted the blade that helped her sacrifice for the clan, and she reread the scene over and over again just to try and find similarities.1

"Did your grandmother happen to own a Emerson green necklace?" Riley questioned, closing her book and looking at her cousin again, who shrugged before she went back to harvesting the herbs and plants.4


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

"What the hell, Bells?!" Riley cursed as she knelt down to the ground where Jacob and Bella were, Jacob's shirt pressed against Bella's head. "Oh my god, you're bleeding! I told you that you need to where a helmet. This is why you always prepare for the worse, otherwise, you end up injured. We all know how clumsy you are! Oh God, do you need to stitches"+

Riley was cut off from her rambling when Jake pressed his hand to her head, as if checking her for a fever, to which she smacked his hand away with a questioning look.+

"What are you doing?" Riley asked, her eyes travelling his face with a confused expression.+

"Checking to see if you finally snapped" Jake joked, moving his hand back to Bella, gesturing for her to try and get up as Riley scoffed at his rude remarks, before she helped pick up Bella from the ground with one arm.+

"We are officially never riding a motorcycle again" Riley concluded and Jacob actually agree as before they helped Bella limp over to the truck, where Jacob places Bella down in the passengers seat for now, before he ran over to where the bike was so he could carry it back over. "Since when did you have muscles?"+

"Honestly Riley, you never see what's right in front of you unless it's a book" Jake cracked a playful smile at the girl, as he walked past her with the bike in his arms, he walked to the rink and lifted it into it.5

Riley walked behind him and helped him strap it down so it wouldn't fall or anything, before they both smiled and pushed each other playfully again, trying to forget about their ex-friend who was currently jumping off a cliff with the 'gang'.2


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

Riley tapped her pen against the notebook she was holding multiple times, her brain not seeming to come up with any fresh ideas for some writings, since she hadn't seemed to find a muse yet in her life and instead had been filled to the brim with new stress.+

She glanced over to where her camera was before she shook her head from the thoughts and looked back at the blank piece of paper, then, her eyes seemed to drift to her window, where the woods were clearly lay out in front of her.+

"It wouldn't hurt to go out for an hour or two" Riley mused to herself, finally giving in to her twitching fingers and racing towards her camera so she could go snap a few pictures for inspiration, she hadn't done it in a while since she had been so stressed out due to Bella.+

But now seemed like the perfect time as Bella was out and her father was at work, so, she wrapped herself up warm and wandered through the opening near her house, not going to far just in case.+

"Perfect" Riley let out with her mouth open wide as she examined the trees, she lifted her camera up and noticed the last photo that was on her camera, a photo of Bella and Edward on Bella's 18th birthday.+

She sighed before she changed her camera's lense and snapping a few photos of the trees from an upwards view, seeing as she wasn't the tallest while the trees toward over the high school.+

The birds suddenly scattered away in a massive group and she snapped a picture before she noticed the distress of the birds, there wasn't a normal pattern of their flying or their form, meaning they were scared away...but by what? She thought the 'cold ones' had left.2

A twig snapped nearby her and she gasped before she snatched up her bag that she had placed on the floor and she kept her eyes on a particular place where she could swear she saw eyes looking at her.+

She blinked harshly before opening up her eyes and seeing nothing, she shook her head at her own imagination before deciding to retreat back home to safety, enough Nancy Drew over the supernatural today.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

According to Bella, Jake had totally flipped out on Mike Newton at the cinema and then had disappeared into thin air afterwards, Billy Black had informed Bella that Jake had mono.1

Which Riley called total lies, since she knew about the legends and she knew what was most likely happening to Jake at current times, although she made no attempt to talk to him as she knew he probably wouldn't even answer her.1

It seemed as though they were back to square one, Bella Sean screaming at the top of her lungs just when life seemed to turn better, Charlie Swan falling asleep ok the couch whenever he came home, Riley Swan breathing in coffee even though she hated it with every cell in her.+

Riley didn't hate Jake because he had chosen to abandon her, she hated Jake because ha he abandoned Bella and now she seemed to be in a viscous cycle where people constantly seem to be leaving her behind and cutting her off.+

Riley felt empathetic towards the girl and tried her best to soothe her, just as she did when Edward originally left, but it was to know Advil.6

Riley felt utterly and completely hopeless, and she knew the only thing she could do to make herself feel better, would be to scream at someone, she needed to let go of the constant screams that she had trapped so her father didn't have to deal with two of them.+

So, there she sat tapping her fingers on the steering wheel outside the Black residence, chugging down her coffee every few seconds to try and help the jittering and tiredness that her body seemed to be under.+

Her plan had been set out perfectly, see Jake, blow up at Jake and then leave...6

But, here she sat with a stupid meal that she had cooked for Billy, an excuse that she was going to use to get into the house where she'd hopefully see Jake...so she could explode and then leave.+

She let out a sigh of exhaustion before she jumped out of Bella's car that she had borrowed, and she walked towards the door holding the homemade meal, she knocked on the door lightly and tapped her foot as the wait began.+

The door creaked open and she looked down slightly to see a frowning Billy, who covered his surprise up with a smile. "Oh hey, Riles, you know Jake is sick right? Unfortunately, you can't see him at this moment..."+

"I came here to see you" Riley cut him off with such courage that she surprised herself, but her shyness covered over her cheeks in a bush as she held up the wrapped up plate. "I figured...since Jake wouldn't be able to help cook, I'd make you something"+

Billy smiled up at the sweet girl and gestured for her to hand it over, which she did with a polite smile before she awkwardly waved and turned to leave, the door closing as she walked down the porches stairs.+

A figure seemed to pop up nearby and she did a double take when she saw the shirtless boy, who froze in his place when he spotted Riley, her coming to a stop as well.+

"You're not supposed to be here" His voice turned harsh and bitter, which caused a shiver to spread through her body before she turned her head to him fully so she could see her true face currently.+

She glared at him, "cause you have mono? Yeah, I know. I heard all the excuses your father passed along to Bella, but I'm not here for your snippy attitude, I came to drop off some food I made for your dad"+

Jake seemed to think it over before he nodded, "just don't come here again"+

Riley tilted her head cockily, "or what? You'll release the Wolves on me?" And when she got the reaction she needed to prove she wasn't crazy, she nodded and moved along towards Bella's car, ignoring the look of Jake's face when she drove past him.29


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

One thing that Riley had certainly not expected to be dragged out of bed by Bella, it was certainly a shock to even see the girl out of bed, but when Bella had actually spoken and told Riley to get dressed to go confront Jake, Riley was speechless.+

Something that happened rarely in the world, but Bella seemed to have other things on her mind as she drove the pair over to his house like a maniac.+

Riley didn't want to go confront Jake, especially since she had admitted opening with a snide remark that she knew about the wolves, and other things, if Jake was smart enough to piece it together.+

Bella had stormed off towards the house while Riley decide to suck away from view and focus on reading the legends again, knowing that she was in their territory and so she should probably be prepared for anything.+

She had just gotten to the take of the throes wife again when she heard a loud slam that cause her to jolt and hit her head on the roof of the car, she cringed and held her head for a few seconds before opening her eyes to see Bella—who seemed to notice a bunch of boys walking over towards Jake's house.+

"Oh no" Riley mumbled, moving to get out, only for the seatbelt to tug on her and she snapped her attention to trying to get it off of her. "Oh my God..."+

She finally got the seatbelt undone before she jumped out of the actual car and closed the door, making her way over to where Bella had pushed—she thinks—Paul Lahote, who seemed to be laughing throughout the whole situation.+

"What did you do?" Bella shouted at them, her anger only seeming to rise as Riley made her way over quickly, wanting to break it up before Bella became a chew toy.+

"Easy" Sam warned the others, who got defensive when she had pushed their alpha, which Riley easily picked up on.+

"He didn't want this" Bella yelled at them, Riley finally reaching them and grabbing Bellas hand so she could try and tug her back. +

"What did we do?" Paul Lahote seemed to let his anger take over him, and Riley looked over at him curiously, their eyes meeting momentarily and his constant shaking seemed to freeze as he took in her hazel eyes, wanting to examine them longer as he felt an instant pull move from the core of the Earth to her, but the feeling of a fresh love soon washed away as Riley continued to tug Bella, removing her eyes from the strange boy with a temper problem.59

"They don't chose this, Bells" Riley stated in a pleasing tone, and some of the boy looked at the girl in confusion.+

"Stay quiet for one moment, Riley" Bella snapped at her sister, who instantly shut her mouth and took a step backwards.5

"What did he do, hmm? What'd he tell you?" Paul suddenly was angry again, his body shaking erratically as Riley pitched her breathe, knowing the outcome of this.+

"Both of you, calm down" Sam tugged Paul back slightly as he glanced between them, Riley nodding in agreement as she tried to take Bella, who only shrugged her hand off.+

"Nothing. He tells me nothing because he's scared of you" +

Paul and Jared seemed to let out a laugh at that, Paul's seeming to raise butterfly's in Riley's stomach that she quickly tried to hide away as she was worried by her sister.6

Bella swung her hand out and slapped Paul in the face, Riley gasping in shock as she covered her mouth with both of her hands. +

"Too late now" Jared seemed to let out a sarcastic remark, as Sam stepped forward to t try and calm Paul down.+

Riley slowly made her way towards Bella's hand, tugging on it gently, before she whispered. "Bella, stand back"+

"Bella, Riley, get back!" Sam yelled at them, Bella taking it as her turn to drag Riley backwards with her. "Paul, calm down, now"+

His snarling and panting only seemed to increase and Riley let out a whimper as his jeans tore and he transformed into a wolf right in front of them, his main target being her older sister.+

"Bella, run!" Riley turned her head to her sister, who immediately nodded and began to make her way towards Jake's house, Riley following close behind.+

"Bella! Riley!" They heard Jake yell their names as he jumped over his porch and Riley stopped suddenly as she took on what was in front of her, she jumped forward and dragged Bella down, just in time for Jake to jump over them and shift mid-air, instantly fighting Paul off.+

"Had to be wolves" Riley groaned as she felt her arm bleed slightly from impact, her sister on the floor next to her, her mouth open wife as she watched the wolves tackle each other.+

"Hey, take them back to Emily's place" Sam commanded Embry and Jared, and Riley sent Embry a small smile when he reached her side.+

"Hi Riles, how've you been?" He asked politely, with a slight teasing tone to his voice as he lifted her up onto her legs. +

"Oh you know, not been shifting into a wolf, if that's what you mean"6


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

They arrived to a small and cozy looking house that laid in the middle of the Rez—that essentially looked like the middle of nowhere—but the place made Riley reach for her camera, only to realise that she hadn't brought it with her.+

The boys jumped out of the trunk and let out a weird noise that Riley scrunched her nose at, Bella winding down her window with concern. "Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay"+

And Riley secretly wanted to add on Paul's name for some reason, even if he had just tried to basically eat his sister, she did slap him, but Riley didn't think that was a good enough excuse.+

"I hope Paul sinks some teeth into him, serves him right" Jared bets to Embry, and Riley almost smiled at the familiar memory of betting.+

"No way, Jacob's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I got five says Paul doesn't touch him" Embry bets, the girls still in the car as the two boys walk on ahead.+

"We should go..." Riley trailed off, feeling as though she was only evading their space, she wanted to go home to the comfort of her room.+

"No way, I'm not going alone" Bella shook her head at her younger sister, before she jumped out of the car and sent Riley a look through the window.+

"Maybe I should just...stay here" Riley suggests, and Bella glowers her eyes lightly.+

"You're bleeding, we need to get you fixed up" Bella concluded, and Riley scoffed before she jumped out of the car slowly, clinging on the her bag as if it was her very own soul.2

"Come on in, ladies. We won't bite" Embry called to them, and Hared sent a smirk their way.12

"Speak for yourself"+

Bella grabbed Riley's gold arm and guided the girl towards the house, coming to a stop as the boys tried to earn them. "Oh hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancé. Don't stare. It bugs Sam"1

And then they were let in as Bella questioned why she would stare, they reached the room to see a woman taking to the guys, who already had food in their mouth.+

"You guys hungry? Like I have to ask" the women spoke to them, and Riley guessed that was Emily.+

Riley immediately began to hide behind Bella's figure at the new surroundings and people, not entirely feeling comfy about the entire fact that they were literally almost chew toys by a guy that she can't get out of her head.+

The women suddenly turned around a spotted the girls at the door, glancing at the boys at the table she asked "who's this?"+

"Bella and Riley Swan, who else?" Jared spoken again, and Riley almost rolled her eyes at the fact that every sentence she's heard from him, it was a remark.+

Bella felt uncomfortable as she saw the scars, shifting slightly so she could be more in front of her sister.+

"So, you're the vampire girl?" Emily let out a smile, speaking so softly that Riley felt better.+

"So you're...the wolf girl?" Bella remarked as she began to walk into the actual room, Riley walking slightly behind her as she did so.+

"Guess so. Well, I'm engaged to one" Emily returned to comments, carrying over some muffins to the table, as Embry kept his eyes on his shy friend.+

"Save some for your brothers" Emily warned Jared, smacking his hand away as if he was a child. "And ladies first. Muffin?"+

"Sure. Thanks" Bella agreed, walking over to the table on her own and sitting down awkwardly, whilst grabbing a muffin, sending her sister a small look.+

"And you're Riley?" Emily turned to the shyer girl, who still was near the doorway.+

"You're really pretty" Riley blurted out, causing Jared to snort, only to be nudged in the side by Embry who defended his friend with a smile.22

Emily smiled sweetly at the girl, before holding her arms out, "thank you. Now, I see your injured...so sit down and have a muffin while Jared will go get the first aid"14

Jared mumbled something under his breathe before he stood up and left the room quickly, returning a few minutes later and handing the bag to Emily, who instantly began to work on Riley's arm+

"Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order" Emily commented, wiping a tissue over the blood.+

"Um, he didn't say anything to me" Bella admitted from her place, and people glanced at Riley expectedly.+

"Quileute Legends, chapter 1, page 2" Riley explained briefly, trying not to cringe at her arm. "Phasing"+

"It's a wolf thing, not to tell." Embry continued with Bella's confusion, "Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want' em to or not. Oh and check it out, we can read each other's thoughts"+

"Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it! This chick runs with vampires" Jared scolds Embry, while waving his muffin around, Riley rolled her eyes.5

"You can't really run with vampires" Bella concluded. "Cause they're fast"+

Riley thanked Emily silently when she finished applying a bandage on her arm, and the women watched the scene unfold.+

"Yeah? Well, we're faster. Freaked out yet?" Jared questioned.+

"You're not the first monsters I've met" Bella admits, sending her sister a small look to see if she knew anything about the Cullen's.+

"Jake's right. You're good with weird" a voice at the door cuts in, Riley spins around to see Sam enter, making his way towards his fiancé immediately, where he kisses her sweetly with his arms wrapped around her. Then he playfully kissed around her face as she giggles, causing Riley's heart to swoon before she turns to Jared with a matter-of-fact look.+

"You're only shaped to be faster than vampires backseat you were designed to hunt them" She concludes quickly, Bella's eyes widening as she realised her sister knows.7

Embry sticks his tongue out at the girl, before there is more footsteps and the other two boys join, Riley's heart skipping a beat as she spots Paul.1

Paul sits down next to Riley and sends Bella a light smirk, "sorry"+

Bella looks towards Jake, who tilts his head towards the outside, showing they need to talk, but Bella looks back to Riley, who is sat down watching the scene unfold around her. "Riles?"+

Riley glanced between Jake and Bella, cringing when she realised she'd be third wheeling them. "You can go on without me"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Ditching the leech lover for us already? I feel the love" Embry comments the second Jake is far away, and Riley scoffed at him, pushing his arm off her shoulder as she looks down at her muffin.+

"I'll have you know, you don't 'read each other's minds' you can only few what they project, which is usually thoughts. If you're smart enough, you can hide things" Riley corrects Embry from his comment from earlier, and he tilts his head. "Plus, you can only do it when you phase, and I believe it's called a mind-link"1

Jared let out a small 'whoop' before he began to chuckle lightly, "damn, I like this girl, you should stick around"20

Riley just took another bite of her muffin to avoid any eye contact with the person who seemed to be staring at her with a heated gaze, that she could practically feel.6

"So, what else do you know then?" Embry quizzed curiously, wanting to know more. "Cause I thought your sister was the one involved with the leeches and such"+

"I'm not an idiot, I knew my sister was dating a vampire" Riley stated, "I knew that my best friend was one"+

"You had a best friend before Jake?" Embry asked in shock, causing Riley to punch him in the shoulder with her left arm, seeing as her right had just been wrapped up.+

"Yes, you idiot. Jasper Hale, the one who looks like he's in pain?" Riley reminded, and the figure closest to her froze up at the mention of him, "strangely enough, that big monkey guy Emmett, was obsessed with my cousin, like, he would always watch her"20

Riley shivered lightly as the memories came back, before she watched Emily and Sam, who seemed to be in their own world together and her heart ached as it pleaded for something it never even thought about before.+

"Does this mean you'll continue the Saturday night sleepovers?" Embry questioned her again, and she began to feel annoyed with him slightly. "I want another photo with Jake and a disney princess face mask"1

Jared let out a huge laugh as Paul cracked a smile, which made Riley feel as though she had accomplished something.+

"Don't laugh too much, Jared. We may need another person to try one on" Riley warned playfully, causing him to stop laughing and for her and Embry to join in a laughter, her muffin ending up on the table as she held her stomach instead.+

Paul was in awe with his imprint, and his eyes just couldn't look away from her. Jake had only seemed to bite him more when they were fighting earlier, when he had seen that Paul had imprinted, after all, Jake was like her brother. But, Paul only seemed to calm down when Sam had suggested seeing her again, and now here he was examining the way her adorable looking dimples showed up as she laughed with Embry over something completely stupid-to him- but seeing her happy made him crack a smile.15

Everything Sam had droned on and on about when he imprinted on Emily, didn't seem cringe anymore, it just seemed...to be very heart warming, and a goal. He hoped that he would be as close as they are at some point, he wanted to embrace Riley every chance he got, and scatter kisses all over her face as she let out her adorable giggle.56

He was already deeply involved in her, and she didn't have a clue that he was already prepared to hand over his heart.+

Paul stopped smiling for a second when her eyes had turned to him mid-laughing, and their eyes connected all over again, and he smiled at her when he could tell she felt it too, the blush that spread through her cheeks only proved it further.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Damn it Jake! Hold still!" Riley screamed at the boy as she held a face mask sheet in her hands to put on his face, the headband already holding back his hair. 11

The pair had decided to have one of their old sleepovers, even inviting Embry over so that it almost had the full group—minus Quil who still had yet to phase. Riley couldn't help but feel sorry for him, so she had started spending Sunday's with the boy.2

"It's cold!" Jake defended while raising his hands up dramatically, as he flinched away from the mask again.1

"Your like a hundred degrees, you'll get over it" Riley states as she leans forward again, Jake moving his head downwards like a turtle as she did so. "Don't make me sit on you!"3

"You wouldn't dare.."27


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Paul Lahote had been invited over to Riley and Jake's sleepover by Embry, who had spent an hour or so explaining how he needed to actually get to know his imprint. There wasn't much argument from Paul, as he agreed almost immediately.+

Embry had talked him half to death as they walked their together, going on and on about how Riley is an amazing person and is perfect for him—which he already knew.+

But he didn't expect to walk into the black household to see Riley sat on Jake's chest, as she was leaning over applying a disney Princess face mask.1

Embry turned to Paul as he expected him to be angry, but he instead let out a chuckle at the fact that a wolf such as Jake was pinned down by this petite girl—for a face mask.7

"Oh, hi guys! He was being a wuss and Embry—you weren't here to hold him down for me" Riley quickly explained, jumping off from Jake as it suddenly felt wrong under Paul's gaze, which she didn't fully understand yet. She glanced down at her watch. "Ten minutes, Jakey. Don't burst into flames"+

Embry then held up his arm to show the door that he had brought, and Riley's eyes widened in excitement, "we've got all your favourite, from custard creams to cookie dough ice cream"9

Riley walks over to Embry and grabs one of the bags, Paul instantly cutting in and taking the others, before he turned to her expectingly. "Oh, the kitchen"+

The pair walked away from the others momentarily and arrived inside the small yet cute kitchen, where Riley instantly began to unpack the food from the bags as though she was in auto-pilot, Paul leaned against a counter as he watched her every movement, that seemed almost too perfect for him, but he didn't complain over seeing her move around and not mind his company. 1

"Paul? Would you like a drink?" Riley offered to the strange and mysterious guy that had constantly been on her mind for almost a full week. Paul had to fight off any possible reaction to her saying his name until he nodded and asked for some water. "I know you guys eat a lot, so I've actually made a lot of food, although...I didn't know you were coming"+

Riley's face was blushed and Paul couldn't help but react to it, his lips curved into a smile and he took a step towards her and lifted his hand up as his eyes examined her every move.+

Riley's breathe hitched when Paul stood so close, before his hand was lifted up and it began to feel along her cheeks, as though he was memorising her. She could feel her heated face calm down as she watched his eyes closely, only for him to soon stop stroking her cheek and take his hand away—leaving her feeling cold.+

Riley looked from his hand and back to his face, where their eyes met and he have her a heart throbbing smile+

What had she gotten herself in to?1

Riley didn't know what was worse in her current situation, the fact that she found herself at Emily's in an awkward silence, or the fact that the boys were almost all hunting after Victoria--a red headed vampire that was after Bella.+

Riley was sat down opposite Emily and Jake when she suddenly grabbed her chest with a gasp, the other two made their way to her side quickly, the girl face red as se felt her lungs filling with something imaginary.+

"Something's wrong with Bella" Riley finally gasped out, and Jacob stood up abruptly and ran out of the house in such speed that hurt Riley's eyes, knowing he could find her scent Riley calmed down momentarily, Emily remained by the girls side, soothing her back when she began to cough.1

Water spewed out of Riley's mouth and she almost groaned at the feeling of salty waters. Emily, on the other hand, panicked when she saw the water. "Oh my God! What's happening?"6

"Athena found a-a book from her grandmother and.." She stopped when more water spilled out of her mouth, Emily wiping her mouth quickly to try and help. "It's a spell book of some sort, and, well, she linked me to Bella"43

"She did what?!"  Emily exclaimed, before Riley let out water. "Riley, you're practically an ice cube...where is your sister"+

"The cliff, I think" Riley guessed, her body shivering as she hoped Jacob found Bella soon, Emily returned shortly with some blankets, wrapping the girl up like a burrito.+

"What's going on here?" A voice of confusion cut in, and the shivering Riley glanced back to see Embry, before she spurted up more water onto the floor, causing Embry's nose to scrunch up in disgust.+

"She's linked to Bella" Emily explained shortly, rubbing the girls back as another two joined the party. "One of you come warm her up"+

Before Jared had a chance to walked over with his usual smirk, Paul silently walked over to the girl and embraced her into his arms, Riley returning the hug with her petite arms wrapping around his muscular body.+

"Wait" Riley suddenly spoke, standing back from Paul and looking down at her hands that were no longer shaking, "Jake found her"+

"What are you guys doing back here?" Emily suddenly frowned towards the boys, noticing that her wolf wasn't standing there with them.+

"Somethings happened" Embry briefly stated, seeming sorrow all of a sudden and Riley's heart dropped in the next sentence. "Harry Clearwater is dead"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I'm fine to walk, Paul" Riley complained as Paul carried her out of the truck and towards the Clearwater's household, he hadn't moved his eyes away from her for one second.+

"Next time, don't link yourself to your sister" Paul sent her a look as he spoke back, and she rolled her eyes before giving in to leaning against his warm chest. "We're here"+

Riley slid out of Paul's arms—to both of their dismay—before she dashed towards a familiar face, "dad!"+

Charlie opened his arms widely to his daughter, who immediately began to sniffle into his shoulder when he had hugged her.2

"Dad, I'm so sorry" Riley frowned on her fathers shoulder, knowing she saw his red eyes before she hugged him.+

"I need to—I need to see Sue" Her father mumbled to her, and she nodded, pulling back and pressing a kiss to his cheek quickly.+

"I'll go check on Leah and Seth" Riley promised, turning around to walk over to Paul again, who held his hand out to her to grab.+

Riley grabbed the hand with a blush before Paul began to tug her to the trees at the back of the house, which seemed to confuse Riley until she saw two unknown wolves, on more feminine and the other smaller—as though it was younger.+

"Leah? Seth?" Riley quizzed when she saw the wolves, their heads instantly snapping over to her figure, her eyes softened as she looked at the both of them.+

"Paul, get Riley away" Sam commanded to his beta, who went to nod, only to be cut off by Leah sending Sam a threatening growl at the statement.+

"Leah, it's okay" Riley soothed from her place, Paul making sure to stand directly in front of her. "Whatever happened, it wasn't your fault. We just need you to calm down and help your mom and Seth, okay? Can you guys calm down for me?"+

Their was a small shifting sound, before they heard a young voice groaning and clothes being throw towards the newly shifted wolves, Leah grumbling something under her breathe as Paul still stood in Riley's way.+

Riley pushed Paul aside and ran over to hug the Clearwater's into a group hug, that Seth returned quickly and Leah slowly caved into. "It's okay, we're here for you"20

When arriving back home with her dad, she was hurt to see only a note written from Bella, that was simply stating that she went to Italy.15

Which caused Charlie to sigh before he kissed Riley's head and he left to go to bed, Riley wasn't as easy though as her brain shifted to panicking, wondering where her sister was and why.1

What if the red-head got to her?+

Riley paced back and forth lightly as she waited for her cousin to arrive around midnight, her cousin usually snuck over as she was a night owl, and Riley was usually overwhelmed with something.+

The window to Riley's bedroom slid open and Riley sent a soft smile when she saw her cousin climb in, almost tripping over but catching herself.+

"What did Bella do now?" Athena questions with a small sigh, closing the window behind her.+

"Can you use the link to find or see her?" Riley quizzed, Athena seemed to contemplate about it before she billed out the old journal that had linked her cousins a few days prior.4

"Yes, but I can't promise that it won't sting" Athena winced at the idea of her cousin getting hurt, before gesturing for Riley to sit down on the bed. "Maybe you should call one of the dog boys and get them over here, preferably Jacob cause he also has a connection with Bella"+

"Alright" Riley nodded slowly, before searching up Jake's name in her phone and pressing dial, and it began ringing for a while.+

"Riles?" Jake answered in a confused tone, and Riley sighed before she sent her cousin a look for dropping something by accident. "What's going on? It's late..."+

"Jake, I need a favour that I need you not to tell anyone about" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Athena paved in front of Riley slowly, analysing everything on the two pages as she hadn't tried a 'spell' that complicated before, Riley had just been nibbling on her lip as she played with her fingers.+

The window swung open for the second time that night and Athena glared at Jake, "she told you not to tell anyone!"+

"Paul, this is Athena" Jake ignored the girl as he introduced his 'brother' to the angry girl.+

"Athena" Riley said softly, causing something to spread through Paul as he heard her voice. "It doesn't matter, we should get started"+

Athena then nodded with determination before she glanced at the two boys, "I'll need you to hold her down"+

"Hold her down?" Paul questioned gruffly, hating the idea of having to pin his imprint down.9

"The process will hurt at the beginning" Athena quickly explained, before her eyes met Riley's. "Don't fight it"+

Riley nodded before she laid back on her bed upside down, giving the two shifters a look, which caused them to get on each side of her, holding her shoulders gently, Jake grabbed Riley's hand just in case.+

"Oh God" Athena breathed out, leaning forward so her hands rested on the sides of her cousins head., before she started whispering soft words that didn't sound English at all.1

Riley whimpered immediacy after Athena stated, shortly in Paul and Jacob's hold, soon turning more irrational as she tried to break free from it all.+

"Don't fight" Jake reminded the girl he had to shift his hold on, his eyes holding pain as he watched the girl whimpering and gasping next to him.+

Riley suddenly started to scream, which made Paul placed his hand over her mouth so that she didn't wake her dad up, although he hated every second of it as his inner wolf seemed to be crying for her.4

"Done" Athena announced tirelessly, removing her hands and then gesturing for the boys to stand away from her, which they followed reluctantly. "I'm going to ask her what she sees, no matter what, don't touch her"1

Athena then took another deep breathe and looked down at her cousin with sad eyes, vowing to remove the link afterwards.1

"Riley, what can you see?" +

"Cloaks, red cloaks" Riley chimed, her eyes shit as she lay on the bed, almost looking dead. "Bella saved Edward, they're walking somewhere—oh my God, they're eating that girl!"13

"Calm down" Athena instructed, pacing her hand on Riley shoulders, and the girl freezes. "What happening?"+

"There's a man, Aro, he's a...vampire" Riley states lowly, "He can tell Bella's human"+

Jake tensed up on the other side of the room as he listened closely, Bella was with vampires, that they didn't have a treaty with, they could easily kill her.+

Riley shifted her head slightly, uncomfortable with the scene as it continued to play, and she suddenly jumped at something. "He's laughing. He wants her to be a vampire, says she know too much....."+

Aro stood proudly at the front, two other men in the background on some sort of thrones.+

Riley stood in the corner of the room, almost like a ghost in the place, and she gasped when she caught sight of Bella, who was stood next to Edward and Alice.+

"Alice" Riley murmured, and the girl seemed to looked up in her direction momentarily, as though she could see her, or knew that she was there.+

Unlike the Cullen's, these vampires seemed to have glowing red eyes that popped out to her attention right away, Bella had explained the different meanings, so she immediately gulped at the sight of so many of them.+

"Aro can read every thought I've ever had" Edward explained to Bella, who's good beside him, and Riley could feel the tense air. "And now you know everything, so get on with it"+

He can feel the blood singer bond, Riley thought to herself.+

Edward pulled away from Aro, as the man's lips twitched lightly, Riley held in her breathe as another vampire walked past her, worried if they could sense her.+

"You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward" Aro replied, his voice so low that the whole room had felt in solitude. "Though...you can't read Bella's thoughts"+

Read Bella's thoughts? Like a power?+

Aro went on to how excited he was to see an example of Bella's gift, which made Riley cringe to herself, how could he even do that?+

Bella held her hand out to Aro, and he laughed manically as he couldn't read her mind, Riley felt her body feel weird as he tried to read Bella, the link working.+

"Let us see if she is immune to all our powers" Aro concluded, and Riley immediately went to guard Bella—even as a ghost thingy—only for Alice to hold her hand out secretly when she had approached them. "Shall we, Jane?"+

Riley looked over to this 'Jane' person, who smirked at Bella immediately.+

Edward seemed to notice this and move to run forward, "no!"+

"Pain" Jane simply stated as she looked at him, and his whole body went ridged as he began to crumble to the floor.+

Riley let out a scream that was silent to everyone but herself, and ran forward to hold his shoulders, his head lulled to the side slightly as if he could see her.+

Or read my thoughts.+

"Stop! Don't, please stop." Bella begged, and Riley looked over her should let at where Bella was. A boy stepping forward to hold her back. "Just stop hurting him! Please! Please!"+

Alice leaned down on the opiate side of Edward and examined him, her hands holding him gently, Riley was sure that if she could cry—she would.+

"This might hurt, just a little" Jane had told Bella, narrowing her eyes down at the girl, who didn't even flinch.+

"She's immune" Riley thought out loud, Alice sending her a slight nod. "This is getting weird"+

Aro let out a huge laugh, that caused Riley to flinch massively, his hands clapping in amusement. "Remarkable, she confounds us all. So, what do we do with you now?"+

"You already know what you're going to do, Aro" One of the older guys on a throne stated, seeming almost bored with the whole ordeal.1

Riley immediately stepped up slowly and made her way to Bella, taking cautious steps backwards as she reached her sister, their hands brushing, and Bella shivered as if she could feel it.+

The link, Riley suggested to herself.+

"She knows too much" the other one concluded, and Aro seemed almost sad that he couldn't keep his play thing. "She's a liability"+

Aro sighed, "that's true. Felix"+

The boy who was once holding Bella let go and walked over to the side quickly, Bella spooning round as another man started to walk towards them.+

"No" Edward intervened, spinning Bella around so he could fight him.+

While Edward charged towards the guy named Felix, Alice was pulled as someone grabbed her throat.+

Riley ran towards Alice and tried to pry the fingers off the man, who seemed confused when there was a force pushing against his fingers, but Riley stopped as the man named Felix had finally pinned Edward to the floor, turning to Bella with such speed neither had witnessed before.+

Edward!! Riley screamed in her brain, before the boy stood up again and began to fight.+

"No, no! Please, please! Kill me, kill me. Not him" Bella begged, and the room paused at the girls sudden outburst, Riley sending her sister an unknown look.+

Riley suddenly felt as if she was being pinched, and she panicked as Aro began to walk towards Bella, but she couldn't hear what he was saying to her, as the image seemed to fade away and she screamed out for her sister.+

Riley shot up with a gasp, instantly gasping as someone wrapped their arms around her and she reacted almost immediately. "Oh my God, Bella"+

"We heard everything you thought and spoke" Athena whispered, her voice seemingly strained as her eyes were red from tears. "I had to get you out of there when you said that they could feel you"+

Riley blinked, removing her arms slowly from Paul, who seemed to be the first person she subconsciously grabbed when she had woken up from that nightmare.+

"It was horrible" Riley admitted, her voice breaking halfway through. "They were going to kill all of them"+

"I removed the link" Athena spoke softly, taking a seat next to Riley, before brushing some of the girls hair that seemed to be stuck to her face with sweat. "You should get some rest, Bella should be home in a few hours."1

"I-I can't, can you stay with me?" Riley asked Athena, who nodded softly, and then Riley looked over to see Jake watching in the corner, and she held her hand out for him to grab. "You too, we can have a sleepover"+

Jake nodded, reaching forward and grabbing her hand, only for her to tug him onto the bed and hug him. "I'm glad you're not connected anymore, Riles"+

"Me too" Riley admitted, rubbing his back slowly, before she glanced at Paul. "Would you like to stay too?" +

"I better go catch up with Sam, tell him the Cullen's are heading back" Paul said, his arms crossed as he seemed to be quite rude, but Riley gave him one of the softest smiles he's ever seen anyway.+

Riley had woken up to a screaming, and she sighed of relief when she realised it was her sister.+

She had to remove Jake and Athena's arms and legs away from her before she crawled out of her room and into Bella's, who was whimpering and shouting in her sleep. "Stop it, stop!"+

As she woke up, Edward had been there holding her hand, and Riley sighed as she saw her sister calm down.+

"You can sleep" Edward softly told her, and Riley decided to stay in the doorway to see what would happen. "I'll still be here when you wake up. Bella, the only reason I left, was because I thought I was protecting you. I need to you to have a chance at a normal life, a happy life."+

"It was easy for you to leave"+

Edwards shook his head, "leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in a hundred years. I swear, I will never let you fall again. I'm so sorry"+

Bella seemingly fell asleep after Edwards's comforting words, and Riley walked in more, Edward's eyes still on Bella's figure.+

"Hey, Edward" Riley smiled.+

"Hi, Riley" Edward greeted back, finally looking away from Bella. "I could hear your thoughts"+

"Athena linked us" Riley explained shortly, before she surprisingly stepped forward and hugged him tightly. "I'm so glad you're all okay"+

Edward let out a small sigh that sounded more that a laugh, before he hugged her back tightly, realising how tired she was from her thoughts, so he pulled back with a certain look. "You, need some sleep."+

"We we're having a moment" Riley returned, sighing slightly before she nodded and began to leave the room, turning back to say. "Athena's going to kill you"1

"I know" was the last thing she heard him say, before she closed the door and retreated to where there were two heavy sleepers in her bed.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

A few nights after, Riley was invited to the Cullen's house by Bella and Edward, although she didn't understand why.+

Riley had fought with both Athena and Jacob about going over to the Cullen's, as neither trusted the 'blood suckers' and believed they were going to turn Bella soon, which Riley hated the idea of but she hadn't spoken to anyone about it.+

It was Bella's choice after all.+

After many arguments with the pair, they decided that Athena had to go with them, since she had been practicing her 'magic' which still creeped everyone out, mainly Athena since she almost killed one cousin cause the other one was basically suicidal.4

"Edward" Athena gave the vampire a tight smile when she caught sight of him, knowing very well that she couldn't do anything in current times in front of Riley. +

"Athena" Edward nodded back, Bella at his side, clinging to his hand as she glanced between her boyfriend and her cousin.+

Athena had to fight off every urge to make Edward be set on fire, which had irritated her the whole car ride there, never mind standing in front of him.+

"I want to see Jasper" Riley grinned, her arm looped with Athena's as she was practically bouncing in her place, oblivious to the tension in the room.+

"There in the main room, we're just about to start" Edward informed them, gesturing for them to go before him, and Athena glared at him as Riley began to tug her along.+

When she reached the top of the stairs, she gasped as she caught sight of her blonde best friend. "Jas!"+

She ran into his arms, and he caught her with a laugh, giving her a small spin before placing her down on her feet and smiling down at her excited face, he always loved the emotions she was feeling as they were always comforting. "Hello, ma'am"14

Riley let out a giggle, before being tackled by Alice. "Ali!" She shouted before hugging her back, Athena standing behind them awkwardly as she felt familiar eyes on her again. "We have so much catching up to—there was a total blah phase in my fashion, before I decided on the comforting autumn vibe one. Oh—Athena is like, a witch or something now. I was linked to Bella! We met wolves! It was amazing!"1

"That's where that wet dog smell came from" Emmett commented, Rosalie scrunching her nose beside him as Thomas had his arm wrapped around her.6

Alice was stood with the mystery tanned boy, who Riley had yet to know the name of. Esme and Carlisle—whom she hadn't really met before—where stood together with warm smiles, she could tell they were great parents, if they weren't actually parents.+

"I hung out with Jake today" Riley admits, glancing over at Athena, who walked forward to take her hand. "And Athena, we've become like a trio"+

"Cause Jake and I are always looking after you" Athena countered, actually warming up to the room slightly better, before it was replaced with a scowl as she noticed Bella and Edward walk down the stairs.+

"You all know what I want" Bella states, Athena's grip on Riley's hand seemed to increase, the younger girl cringing slightly. "And I know how much I'm asking for. The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair, is to just vote."1

Edward tried to speak, but Bella quickly told him to shut up as Alice smiled softly at the pair, the mystery guys arms wrapped around her.1

"Alice?" Bella started, Alice walked forward to give her a hug.+

"I already consider you my sister" They had a few seconds before she pulled back with a grin, "yes, same with Jaxon"28

"I vote yes" Jasper said, "it would be nice to not want to kill you all the time" 2

At his struggle, Riley grabbed his hand with her spare one and gave it a squeeze, which he softly returned before they looked back.+

"I'm sorry, I'm really sorry to both of you how I've acted" Rosalie chose to speak next, sympathy in her tone. "And I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother. But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself and I wish there had been someone to vote no for me. So, no" +

Thomas seemed to hug her closer at that, her head cradling into his chest as he did so, and Riley almost awed at the sight. "I vote no, with Rosa"+

"I vote, hell yeah" Emmett smirked, picking Bella up and twirling her around quickly. "And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way"1

"I already consider you apart of the family. Yes." Esme smiled, Athena sucked in her breathe next to Riley.+

Carlisle walked forward next, his eyes mainly focused on his son who stood on the stars with a painful expression. "Why are you doing this to me? You know what this means"+

"You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice. I won't lose my son." Carlisle states, settling back beside his wife soon after.+

"Athena? Riley?" Bella turned to her cousin and sister, a hopeful expression across her face and eyes.+

Athena finally let go of her breathe with a small scoff, and she let go of the death grip on torus hand and walked over to Bella, analysing her face closely before she shook her head in disbelief and stormed out of the room.4

Riley made her move to go after, only for Emmett to put his arm out. "I'll go make sure she's okay"1

After Emmett had left, Bella maintained her eyes on her sister. "Riley?"+

Jasper grabbed Riley's hand in support, "well, I saw you when he was gone and I also see you when he's here, you've chosen that you can't live without him either. I must respect the choices you make, as you are no longer happy with just us—you're family—I will respect it, but I will not like it. I wouldn't chose this either, so therefore I'm not going to vote"2

"Oh God, you stink" Jake wafted his hand in front of his face, Athena and Riley had just returned home, where Jake was going to take them over to Emily's so they could introduce Athena to everyone. "Please shower before we go"+

"You'll get over it" Athena resorted, dragging Riley towards his truck, pushing Riley in first so she could be closer to the personal space heater. +

"Did you have fun then?" Jake teased Athena, as she jumped in beside Riley with an agitated look on her face. "Aren't you just a ray of sunshine"+

"Shut up" Athena hissed, shoving her bag down  before placing her head on Riley's shoulder. "I need coffee, and I was just in a house full of blood suckers, so could you not"+

"We had to dress fancy as well" Riley added on a complaint, glancing down at the flowery dress she had on. "And it's freezing cold outside, and I still had to wear a dress"+

"I'm sure Paul would love to warm you up" Jake resorted, his nose twitching slightly. "If he doesn't blow up when he smells leech on you"1

"For the last time" Riley dragged her sentence out with a whine, "stop calling them leeches! They are good people!"+

"I'm surprised you haven't asked about Bella yet" Athena noted, sensing a change in his aura, before her eyes widened in realisation. "You imprinted!"+

"Really?!" Riley added on to the excitement, grinning at him expectingly, Jacob's mum—Sarah— had told her all the legends, not forgetting about how she had a book about it and everything.+

She just didn't know she had been imprinted on.+

"What's her name?" Athena quizzed, wanting answering so she could possibly stalk any social media she may have.18

"No, weren't not doing this" Jake told them strictly.9


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

By the time they arrived at Emily's, Athena and Riley knew everything about the girl that Jake knew, he couldn't help but tell his closest friends as he knew they wouldn't tease him or embarrass him.+

The rest of the pack didn't even know that he had imprinted, they just thought that he had grown up from the crush he once had on Bella.+

"It's weird that she's a Scorpio, considering she acts the complete opposite" Athena notes down, as they finally are getting out of the truck, Athena closing the door once Riley had crawled out like a hyper child.11

"Enough about her, let's go introduce you to everyone!" Riley cheered, grabbing Jake and Athena's hands before she started to drag them along, toward the house.15

The house was busy as usual, the whole pack eating all of Emily's delicious food at the round table, but it seemed to had grown in size since last time she was there, and it had only been around a week or two.+

"Okay, Athena, I'll point everyone out" Riley informed the older girl, who had everyone's eyes on her. "Emily and Sam—pack leader and his imprint slash best women ever, you have Seth and Leah Clearwater—the ones I told you about, that's Jared, the one who thinks he can flirt. Embry, total sweetheart when he wants to be. You know Jake and Paul. Oh! And Quil!"+

Athena sent the room a small wave, Jared had a look of confusion on his face from Riley's chatter, Emily was in awe, Embry was blushing. Seth was smiling, while Leah practically hid in the corner.+

"Everyone, this is Athena" Riley returned, "my cousin and a witch, I guess"+

"Can I eat now? More important things" Jake teased behind the girls, Riley still holding his hand, which Paul had his eyes on the whole time. +

"Jake Black, go back to drooling at the wall" Athena lifted her hand and slapped the back of his head, Riley ducking as she let go of both of their hands.+

"Come over and eat, the boys can move" Emily offered sweetly, Jared frowning again before Emily walked him with a tea towel, which caused him to rush out of the way with a Yelp. "There, Athena"2

Athena sat down and quickly grabbed a muffin that had looked nice, Riley walked over to the table and looked around at where to sit, only for Paul to grab her waist and drag her into his lap, causing sparks to fly where he touched her.19

"I'm too hungry to bother with kicking your arse right now, Lahote" Athena mused, dusting her hands off as she moved on to her second muffin. "Still magically drained from kicking Emmett's butt"2

"You beat up Emmett? I thought he was supposed to cheer you up" Riley's spoke softly, with a hint of confusion, Paul's hands still wrapped around her waist as she leaned against his chest comfortably.+

"He offered for me to release my anger out on him, so I wouldn't end up killing Edward" Athena snorted in amusement, Riley's eyes widening.2

"You smell like them" Paul whispered into her neck, as he placed his head onto her shoulder, nuzzling softly.+

"Sorry, I'll shower next time" Riley promised with a grin.+

"Dad, have you ever had someone stuck in your head?" Riley questioned on a Saturday evening, her legs on his lap as they watched the game.+

Charlie's head instantly snapped over to where Riley was fiddling with her fingers, and nibbling in her own lip. "What do you mean?"4

"There's this—person, and I can't seem to get them out of my head. And, when they do little things, like say my name or grab my hand—tingles spread through my body and...it's hard to explain" Riley chattered on, her face blushing as she continuously played with her fingers.+

"Sounds like a crush to me, Riles" Charlie states, even though it pained him to say it, especially to his youngest.+

"But, it feels more...intense than a crush...kind of like the L-word" Riley explained, and Charlie sighed softly at his youngest.61

"Well, sounds to me like you need to have a conversation with this...'person' about how your feeling, and see if they feel the same" Charlie advised, Riley finally looking up with a hopeful look. "There's always a chance that they feel the same things as you"+

"Really?!" Riley exclaimed, hopeful and excited.+

Charlie nodded, "it's hard not to fall for a sweet girl like you, Riles. You're a catch. Now, you talk with this person and then send me to me afterwards, I can give them a nice...chat"10

"Dad!" Riley whines, potting slightly at her dads antics, before her phone chimes and she picked it up quickly. "I need to go, Athena wants to hang out" +

"Okay, be back before six" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"So, what are we doing out in the middle of no where?" Riley questioned, zipping up her coat when she felt another chill from the cold weather, Athena ahead of her with a wistful look.+

"One, I learnt a new spell. And two, we need somewhere where nobody is listening in, I have something to tell you" Athena explained quickly, and Riley nodded before they continued their hike, a bag full of snacks and a container of coffee for Athena.1

"So, the spell..what exactly is it?" Riley asked, as they arrived at some sort of field, that almost seems lively as they were entering spring again.+

"One you'll love" Athena promises, placing the bag down gently before gesturing for Riley to hand her hand over. "Close your eyes"+

Riley followed her cousins orders, closing her eyes gently as she could feel her cousins eyes on her, their hands joint.+

"Open them" Athena let out in a softer tone, almost as if it was a whisper.+

When Riley opened up her eyes, she gasped at the sudden field that was filled to the brim with colourful flowers, and she got even more excitement when Athena handed her one of her favourite camera's.+

"Thought it would give you some inspiration" Athena gave the girl a smile, and Riley snatched up her camera quickly and sat down on the ground, taking some pictures around them, Athena sitting opposite her. "Now, I need to tell you something really important"4

"I'm all ears" Riley promised, even placing her camera down as gently as possible, she hadn't seen her cousin look so confused since she had tasted coffee for the first—which soon became an obsession.+

"You know how vampire mate? And the wolves imprint?" Athena asked, and Riley nodded along. "Well, in witches, we apparently call them our Beloved's."  (Be-love-ed) 25

"Have you...?" Riley trialed on, her eyes wide.+

"I now know why Emmett was always watching me, because I'm supposed to be his mate and he's my Beloved" Athena continued, Riley mouth open wide. "And now I have no idea what to do"10

"Oh" Jasper cringed as his nose wrinkled up slightly in disgust, and Riley lifted her arms up dramatically as she stood in front of him, everyone else walking around the shops.+

"What do you guys want from me?! I shower and shower for you, just so I don't 'smell' like the other one, I have ran out of freaking moisturiser, my skin is so dry from having to wash from your remarks, one more comment out of you and you'll be sleeping with the fishes" Riley snaps at Jasper, and his lips curl slightly in amusement, Riley's eyes widen. "Sorry, I'm just—"4

"Stressed, I know" Jasper cut her off, before he held his arm out to her, "End of year exams are pushing you, so, how about a pedicure, my treat"18

"I've never had one before" Riley admits sheepishly as she takes his arm, and the pair begin to walk down Port Angeles.1

"All the more reason" Jasper sent her a knowing smile, and Riley hummed as she realised Alice had told him something. "So, how is is going with Paul?"3

Riley eyes instantly brightened as she heard the name, and Jasper smiled when he could see the look on her face as her head spun around to look at him. "Great, he's an amazing friend!"+

"Friend?" Jasper drawled on, still walking them both towards a nail salon, and Riley blushed slightly as she dropped her head.+

"We're different ages—a—and I'm sure he doesn't want to be with someone so 'childlike' and 'innocent'" Riley explained with a frown on her lips, and Jasper patted her arm with his free hand.+

"None sense" He simply said, not saying anything else as he stepped forward and opened up the door for her to enter, Riley walked in with a smile.5

"Mr. Hale, where's Alice?" The worker questioned brightly, her smile very much real and gentle, and then she spotted Riley. "This your girlfriend? She's adorable!"1

"Oh, no" Jasper shook his head with a smile, before he wrapped an arm around Riley's shoulder. "This is Riley, my best friend and she has never had a pedicure"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Oooh, they're pretty" Emily fawned as she held Riley's hand, before she released them gently and turned back to stirring the brownie mixture. "Where'd you get them done?"2

"Erm, I think it was called 'luscious nails' or something. I don't really remember, Jasper took me" Riley explained shortly, Emily nodding along as she listened. "So, how's the new girl settling in?"+

"She has a lot of hidden anger" Emily began, "and sadness, she hates the idea of isolating her friend, as her friend is a freshman or something and is new, I hate that they have to do that"+

"Then why do they block out there old friends?" Riley quizzed, her eyebrows furrowing as she continued to apply the icing on top of some cupcakes. She remembered the whole ordeal with Jake, Embry and Quil.+

"I never really understood, I know there is a risk, but it's not worth you loosing a part of yourself. Sam is the boss though" Emily chattered on, before she glanced at the clock. "Speaking of which, they should be home soon"+

"I might go before then just so I can annoy Jake and Paul" Riley teased playfully and Emily let out a laugh.+

"And risk their jealousy on me? No thank you" Emily smiled as she continued her task, pouring the brownie mix into a tray, that had a sheet inside so there wouldn't be any sticking or mess.+

"I think it would be funny" Riley countered, holding her her icing tube up as if it looked threatening.+

"What would be funny?" Sam enters the room, shirtless as always, before he walks over to Emily and circles his hands around her waist, kissing her scars as she leans into him.+

"If Riley left before Jake and Paul saw her" Emily responded with a small smile, gently nudging Sam so she could show that she had to get the brownies into the oven, but he quickly grabbed her when she had finished doing so.2

"It would be entertaining" Sam countered, sending Riley a smile for a greeting, which she widely returned.+

"Oh, Sam" Emily spun in his arms, so she could meet his eyes for a conversation. "Riley had her first pedicure today"3

"Well...done?" Sam let out slowly, Riley giggled to herself lowly as she placed down the icing tube and picked up the plate of cupcakes to show Emily, who nodded and pointed her to the table.3

"Oh, I didn't know you guys were here" Riley grinned as she saw Embry and Jared sat at the table together, awaiting food, she placed the plate down. "You know Emily's rules, save some for the others"2

"So, see anything today?" Riley conversed with the two boys, who sat at the table with fresh cupcakes, she sat down carefully before taking one for herself.+

"Nothing out of the ordinary" Embry spoke, although it was muffled by the cupcake in his mouth, causing Riley to scoff at his manners before she snatched his arm. "Ow! What was that for?"+

"Don't talk with your mouth full, it's inappropriate and gross" Riley explained quickly, peeling the cupcake liner before she took a small bite out of it, humming as she found it soft and fluffy. 3

"Sorry" Embry apologised, and Riley sent him a smile to say it was all okay, which lead to Embry picking up another ad Riley took her second bite.+

The door then slid open, causing Riley to jump at the sudden sound before she recognised the heavy footsteps, so she spun around to give them a greeting smile.+

"Hi Jake" Riley waves at him, and he almost froze in his place as he realised she was here, after all there was a new shifter who still wasn't under fully control yet.+

"What is she doing here?" Jake questioned, his eyes glancing between the useless boys who sat at the table, they shrugged in response, before Sam and Emily came out of the kitchen with more food.2

"Why's who here?" Emily quizzed as she settled down the brownies, smacking Jared's hand as he went to grab one first. "Ladies first"+

"Riley, Alisha just shifted two days ago, it's not safe for her to be here" Jake responded, his temper rising at the thought of his best friend being hurt, which caused Riley to jump out of her seat at his tone and to grab his hand comfortingly.2

"You do realise I just spent the day with a vampire who wants to kill every human I sight because he sucks as self control? Right?" Riley countered, and Jake began to panic even more.2

"Bella let you hang around a vampire with no self control?!"+

"Not the point I was trying to make" Riley cut him off from any rambling, "my best friends are a wolf and a vampire, my cousin is a witch, I think I can handle being in the same room as a new shifter, after all, you'll be here to step in"+

Jake sighed in defeat, before he stormed over to the table and slouched down into a seat, grabbing a cupcake as he mumbled something to himself, Jared soon repeating it in a sarcastic tone.+

"Don't make me call Kim" Riley threatened, bringing up Jared's imprint caused him to freeze in his place instantly, and Riley grinned in victory.4

"You need to stop hanging out with Paul" Jared pointed out, and Jake nodded in agreement, Riley and Embry shared a knowing look.+

Then, more of the shifters seemed to fill the house and Riley got to greet Seth with a hug, as he really was like her little brother. +

"So much has happened—because I'm one of the newest I can be quite fast, since I'm smaller—oh! and I can also be quite strong, I think I'm stronger than you now Riles"+

"Move over" Leah ordered her brother, when he was hogging all of Riley, and the pack was shocked when Leah pulled Riley into a hug. "You don't visit enough"9

With that, Leah pulled away and sent Riley a look, which caused the younger girl to smile sheepishly at the taller girl. Leah then nodded and moved over so she could brood in the corner, away from everyone else.+

"My turn" Paul joked as he stepped up next, and he wrapped his arms around Riley in a greeting, which she returned happily before she was the one to pull away from him warmth, to both of their dismay. "How was your day with...Jasper?"+

"Great, he took me to get my first pedicure" Riley grinned happily as she held up her hands proudly, and Paul took her hand in his with a soft and small smile, which still seemed to impact her.15

The pair got lost in each other's eyes again as Riley's face settled down into a more relaxed feature, before the door slid open again and Riley's attention snapped over to it.+

A new girl stood on the doorway with short and unruly hair, she seems pissed off at something, which Riley inwardly related to Paul's face when she first met him. +

Riley stepped forward first to greet the girl, "Hi, I'm Riley, want a cupcake? Emily and I made them"1

Paul's hands itched as he watched his imprint stand closely next to the girl, he wanted to drag her away and into his arms.+

"Yes please" The girl let out with a groan, walking forward and snatching up a cupcake that Riley offered. "You must be Riley, I'm so thankful that there is another girl around, these are all really annoying"1

"And over protective" Riley added on, Paul acting offended alongside Jake as they sent each other a look.+

"You get it, my name is Alisha, nice to meet you."1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley Swan+

"You're saying that an army of vampires are coming to kill my sister...and I shouldn't worry?"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Bella Swan+

"Riley, I wasn't the best sister last year, and I'm owning up to that. But you are not getting involved in this battle"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Athena Swan1

"Try that again, I fucking dare you"2

In which, She is willing to give for her sister4


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            14

The sun seemingly stared down at the wondrous land where wolves roamed around in sight of something, something far more dangerous than they had ever met before, and as soon as they got a sniff of gasoline—they immediately went rushing towards the red headed vampire that had been hunting in their land.+

Although, back at the Swan household, nobody knew of anything happening.+

"Mom! I told you, he isn't interested in me like that!" Riley groaned down the phone, where her mother had finally found her charger for her phone, meaning she wasn't using the house one this time.+

There was a chuckle on the other end as the mother shook her head at her youngest's innocence to what was right in front of her. "Riley, he let you paint his nails. He's definitely smitten with you"3

Riley shook her head immediately in denial, Paul only saw her as a friend and she knew it—he had made no advance on her whatsoever, and even if he was, it couldn't happen because he'd end up imprinting on another girl.7

She didn't want to end up like Leah.2

"Whatever mom" Riley stared with an eye roll, before she heard her mom mumble something to Phil, only for Phil to let out an outrageous laugh.+

"See? Friends my arse..." Her mom mumbled as she turned back to the phone, where Riley scoffed lightly.+

"Okay mom, I've got to go, promised Leah that I'd go to the gym with her" Riley smiled fondly as she spoke about one of her best friends, Jasper tying in the top spot with her. "And she hates when I'm late"+

"Okay honey, call me soon, okay?" Her mom spoke back eagerly.+

"Yes! Okay! Now call Bella before it's too late" Riley laughed lightly, before she moved the phone away from her ear and ended the call with a smile on her lips, she was happy that she had a chance to speak with her mom, the last few months had been extremely stressful—it was nice to have an scape for a while.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

"What exactly is the point of this?" Leah questioned as they stood in the gym, her nose crinkled slightly when she smelt a vampire nearby, her body instantly tensing up before Riley revealed Jasper awkwardly.+

"He's a great fighter, he's fought in a war, against newborns and such—we won't go into that" Riley stated awkwardly as Jasper stood beside her with his hands together. "Anyway, I thought that he could teach me to fight and you can burn off some steam"+

Leah eyes up the pair before she let out a sharp nod, it was better than hanging around with her ex-fiancé and her cousin, or any of the pack boys anyway. "Sounds good, you owe me a marathon though"+

"Great" Riley winged slightly, it meant that Leah was going to make her watch the walking dead or something gruesome. "You start ahead, Jasper is going to teach me some warm ups and stuff"10

Leah crossed her arms before she set off towards the boxing area that was set up in the corner, a couple of punching bags screwed into the ceiling so that it was already prepared to be hit.+

Riley turned to Jasper with a small cringe, "so, what's first?"+

"I'm going to teach you the best way to throw a punch" Jasper concluded, grabbing her elbow lightly so he could take her over to a clear area with some mats layers out. "We'll start with some warm ups"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

Riley let out huge pants as she layers on the flier with flushed cheeks, her body sore as she attempted to return her breathing back to how it originally was. "That was your warm up?!"+

Jasper let out a chuckle as he looked down at her form, to be fair, she did do better than most people that he had trained—which were usually training to be vampires or soldiers. "You're doing good, now, let's start off with some basic structures for when you go for a punch"+

"Do I get to punch you?" Riley quizzed as her chest heaves up and down, and she let out a groan as she forced her limbs to stand up on the Matt, where she had basically peeled herself from.1

Jasper let out a small laugh, "we'll work our way up, I don't think your ready for that yet"2

Riley just launched her fist at him as she twisted her body slightly, her fist knocking into his jaw and making him stumble back slightly in shock—and in trying to seem human. "Huh, maybe it runs in the family"1

"Yeah, Athena has a thing for hitting people" Jasper states as he moves his finger alongside his jaw, feeling where she had actually punched him, that seemed to set Riley off.+

"Oh gosh, are you okay? I really just wanted to prove that I could punch—are you hurt?" She spurts out as her hands take ahold of his chin, her eyes scanning over everywhere.+

"I'm fine" Jasper smiled, he seemed to be humerus with her worry, causing her to push him away, barely moving him at all.+

"You're a real jerk, Jas. I thought I hurt you" Riley frowned, before her lips broke out into a smile that she attempted to hide from him, only making him chuckle out loud.+

"Okay, I think this session is over, you're supposed to go to Emily's for lunch"5


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            3

Arriving to Emily's managed to kill out the good mood that Leah had previously been in, her whole figure tended up as her face scrunched up in annoyance.+

"We don't have to eat here, you know? We could always go to yours instead?" Riley offered to Leah, only for Leah to shake her head slightly.+

"Seth's in there" Leah spoke in a deeper tone than before, glaring at the house in front of them as they both sat in her car, her hands clenching onto the steering wheel.+

"Alisha will be there, right?" Riley quizzed, mentioning the other female wolf who Leah tenders to tolerate more than the others, which meant that the pair usually had patrol together.+

"Yeah" Leah nodded to herself, removing her hands from the wheel slowly before they moved to her door, which she pushed open, gaining a comforting grin from Riley in return. "Alright, let's be quick"+

Riley let out a small laugh as she threw her head back slightly, before she slid out of her seat herself, her door being opened by Leah, who seemed to have more manners than the boys.4

The pair walked up to the open house and stepped inside rather hesitantly, Riley opted to stay by Leah's side instead of racing off like she usually did.+

"Hey! How was the gym?" Alisha asked firstly, the others glancing over at the pair once they realised that they were there, most of them weren't even there, leaving the ones that annoyed Leah the most, unfortunately.+

"Great! You have to come some time!" Riley smiled brightly, causing Alisha to smirk at the offer and for Jake to roll his eyes about how open she was being to everyone else, seemed like she was gaining new best friends—he wouldn't admit that he was jealous out loud though.1

"What happened to your hand?" Jared pointed out her hand, which she glanced down at to see it bruised, causing her to grin as she remembered the moment where she had gained it.+

"I punched a vampire in the face" Riley shrugged playfully, causing Jared to let out a huge laugh as he clapped his hands together in an applause, Alisha high fives Riley as Jake grinned.+

"Badass" Alisha notes, before she grabs Riley's hand gently. "But you should get some cream or something on that"1

"I'll go grab some" Leah offered, not really wanting to be in that environment. "First aid kit should be in the kitchen, I'll be right back"+

Leah left the room quickly, wandering off into the kitchen, leaving the boys back to their eating as Alisha stared down at the mark on Riley's hand, for some reason it was bothering her that Riley had hit the vampire.2

"So, who did you hit?" Alisha blurted out, her eyes finally moving from the marks as she met Riley's eyes, and Riley tilted her head slightly in confusion.+

"Jasper" As soon as the words left Riley's lips, Alisha suddenly felt something wash over her, which left her confused. "You should meet him, he's a great fighter. Even offered to teach me"3

"Why would you need to fight?" Jake furrowed his eyebrows, speaking up in the middle of the girls conversation.+

"Because I'm surrounded by wolves, vampires and a witch—or as she prefers, warlock" Riley responded, smiling as Jake finally understood with a small eye roll instead of words. "I'll be surprised if you pass High school, Jake"+

"You seriously need to stop hanging around with who you do, they're rubbing off on you" Jake grumbled, just as Leah returns with the first aid kit and an annoyed looked on her face—meaning Emily and tried to talk to her in the kitchen.+

"Let me do it" Leah snaps at Riley as she pulled the girls hand to her, looking harsh, but she didn't inflict any harm or anything on the girl.1

"How about we head over to yours after this? I believe I owe you a marathon" Riley smiled gently at the older girl, who nodded in return, applying cream to Riley's knuckles as she didn't glance at any of the others.+

"Paul is going to be so mad that he missed seeing Riley" Seth grinned from the sofa, and everyone chuckled out loud, Leah even smiling.7


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Hey dad, what's going on?" Riley asked when she returned from school looking really tired, she had been working extra hard just so she could maybe finish High School at the same time as Bella, but it was proving to be extremely difficult.+

Her dad was hunched over the kitchen table with multiple papers in front of him, causing her to frown at the sight as she placed her bag down beside her, before she stepped forward to examine the scene in front of her.+

"Missing people?" Riley mumbled to herself in confusion, she must to talk the Cullen's about this later. She placed her hand on her dad's shoulder and gave it a comforting squeeze. "Dad? How about you take a break from this?"+

"I will, just after I go over this one more time" Charlie let out with an exhausted look and Riley shook her head at him.+

"You won't be able to help anyone if your this tired, go take a quick nap and I'll wake you up when I've made some food" Riley smiles at him, and he finally turns to look at his daughter, giving her a weak smile back before he stood up gruffly.2

"Alright" He sighed, running his hand over his face. "Is Bella joining us?"+

"She and Edward have until four" Riley reminded with a playful glare at her dad, he had given Edward and Bella a super tight schedule, they were never really together anymore—apart from when Edward snuck in through Bella's window.+

"Yeah yeah" Charlie waved off his daughter before he walked away and disappeared from her sight, causing her to let out a sigh as she turned to the papers quickly, the curiosity getting the better of her.+

She pounced into the chair and began her search through the papers, her hands shifting around as she switched between each page, and she seemingly took it all in, her nose twitching slightly as she focused.+

"What are you doing?" A voice cut in, and her body jolted as she glanced at the figure and gathered all the papers together.+

"Cleaning?" She offered an excuse as she refused to look up at them, and she pushed the papers into the police file and placed it on top of a stack that seemed to be growing weekly. "What did you need, Athena?"+

"Something is going on" Athena stated for a matter of fact, observing Riley as she said it, and she crossed her arms over at her cousin. "And I know you gain gut feelings, so, why haven't you been searching even more?"+

Riley remained silent as she spun her body around to her cousin slowly, who watched her closely like a predator. Athena hummed slightly to herself.+

"Unless you already figured it out for yourself" Athena noted, Riley never gave up on her gut feelings and her suspicions. Take the wolves and vampires for an example.+

"It's a vampire, they're building up their numbers, I don't know why yet. There's nothing connecting them apart from disappearance" Riley spurted it, and it suddenly felt good to reveal her thoughts.+

"Have you told anyone else?" Athena asked, taking a few steps towards her cousin, who shook her head quickly.+

"Bella and Edward are visiting mom this weekend, and I think they're all up to something. There's something else out there now, more deaths are happening again—and these disappearances" Riley rambled on as she began to fiddle with her fingers, before she looked up at Athena. "It can only be one thing"+

Athena smirked to herself slightly, "how would you like to go in a vampire hunt with me this weekend?"2


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Okay, where did you even get that gun from?" Athena whispered harshly over to Riley, who held a shotgun up in her hands, aiming it around to wherever she heard an abnormal sound. 4

"My dad, he gave me one for my own protection, that and pepper spray" Riley replied in a low tone, not wanting to set off anyone's radar, letting them now that they were where they weren't supposed to be.+

"Of course he did" Athena scoffed, pushing a branch away from her face in a mood. "Why did you insist that we walk along the stupid lake, there's so many bushes around here"+

They were on the edge of the lake, wanting to be out of sight from anything that may attack them—or want to drag them away to safety. It was dark outside and the silence was becoming eery to the pair that had been out for over an hour. Riley was just happy that she put on one of her dads jacket on top of her stealth outfit, even if it did ruin the whole plan of being in all black.+

"Victoria will most likely jump between territory's, knowing it'll annoy both sides, this is apart of the line that separates them." Riley states, and Athena turns around to her smartass cousin with an unrecognisable look. "What?"+

"Just don't let any of the others tell you that you shouldn't be involved" Athena shook her head slightly, turning back to observe around them. "Just cause your human, doesn't mean your useless. I mean, you're that smart that you figured out what they are and the location of where Victoria will be—you should be proud. Especially because you're going to finish High School earlier"7

"We don't know that yet" Riley said doubtfully, and Athena rolled her eyes.+

"You'll get into University before me at this rate" Athena scoffed, before her senses picked up on something her and her breathing hitched, causing the pair to freed in their places as they held their weapons at the ready.+

Athena's hands were in the air as they walked forward, prepared to throw anything at what attacked them. Riley held her gun her as she got the trigger in place to pull, her finger lingering at the go.+

"We need to move" Athena instructs out loud, and the pair begin to walk a little faster than they were before, wandering past all the bug trees and bushes, Athena pushing them away with magic as they managed to travel through.+

"Oh my god" Riley opened her mouth as she caught sight of the scene in front of her. 2

Athena immediately placed a spell on the pair of them, allowing them to move faster than the average human—and they chased after the others quickly, wanting to make it to Victoria so they could put her down.+

Victoria jumped in-between the territory's—as Riley thought would happen, even managing to hurt one of the wolves as she went.+

Athena went to run further, only for Riley to hold onto her arm so that the others weren't alarmed of their presence , and Athena nodded wordlessly.+

Victoria had the chance to jump again, only for Emmett to attempt to jump over to the other side with her, his rage gaining the better of him as everyone else seemed to pause in their place—Paul jumping to get in the way of Emmett immediately.2

"Emmett, no!" Rosalie screamed out as she stopped running, and the boys freezed in their places in mid air, inflicting confusion.1

"She got away" Athena cursed as she had her hands held in the air, and the wolves looked to their side to see the two that had suddenly appeared at the scene.+

"Let her, we can get her later" Riley shakes off, before she instructed Athena to dropped the boys with a slight nod to the head.+

Athena scowled at the two she held with her magic, before she flung them over to their own territory's, where they were checked over. They had certainly just given themselves away, they were most likely in trouble.+

"Thanks for not running off after to her" Riley sent Athena a smile, and Athena shook her head as if to say it was nothing. Riley the spun her head around to the others, who were glaring at the other side, forgetting that the girls were there. "What the hell were you all thinking?! Victoria is killing people—she has killed people. And you think it's the perfect time to let and extremely old rivalry get in the way?! This is all about the greater good, you should set aside your differences until this is over"12


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Athena rested her head on Riley's shoulder in exhaustion from the previous nights 'adventures', both sides were in a mood about the pair, and now they basically only had each other to hang around.+

Alisha had apparently imprinted on Jasper, which was a problem as their family's had just had a massive clash over territory. But, Riley had hope for the pair of them, and even (secretly) offered to help Alisha.19

As she knew that the imprint bond was important to wolves, from the tales and the stories from both the book and Sarah.+

"My body aches" Athena groans as she reaches into her bag to take out her coffee flask, and Riley remained silent as she watched everyone moving around in the school car park, the Cullen's avoiding looking at them. "This Beloved bond is killing the crap out of me, not helping the fact that my magic is weak"+

"I wish I could help" Riley frowns, her cousin had been hurting from not seeing Emmett, and from over-using her magic. +

"You might be able too, but you might feel weak after" Athena hummed as she took a sip of her coffee, before she held it in both her hands to heat her up. "I can draw life from living things, but it would take a bigger toll on you cause your human"+

"But, I'm related to you and Bella" Riley concluded as she held her hand out to Athena, who stared at it in confusion. "You guys have proven your strength so many times, the most I can do is be smart and help you guys. You need your magic if Victoria is around"+

"If you're sure" Athena let out lowly, before taking her cousins hand and lifting her head off Riley's shoulder with a gasp, her eyes seemed to glow unnaturally as Riley let out a small seething sound, feeling the energy literally drain out of her and transferring over to Athena. But she didn't mind the pain of it helped Athena.+

Riley's eyebrows furrowed up as she let her head fall down to hide her hurt expression, but it soon stopped as Athena pulled her hand away quickly, and it was Riley's turn to rest her head on her cousins shoulder.+

"Oh wow, that was weird" Athena mused, before she looked down slightly to see Riley had fallen asleep, maybe she had taken too much energy. "Riles?"+

"I'm awake" Riley mumbled, lifting her head up to send her cousin a smile. "I'm fine, it wasn't that bad"+

"Alright, well, I have to get to Math. Can you make it to History without passing out?" Athena questioned, worry etched into her face as she saw Riley's face, but the girl smiled brightly.+

"You sound like me, don't be worried Athena. I though I was the worried one"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

Riley only seemed to get worse as the day went on, the stress of school and Bella's confusion only seemed to add to her tiredness. Jasper couldn't look away from her in History, having sensed that something was off with her—but he still didn't say anything as they had fallen out the other day.7

Bella didn't know what had happened during the weekend and it stressed Riley out, why wouldn't Edward tell Bella that the red headed vampire was after her for revenge? Or even Jake for that matter? Jake had an imprint, that's true. But, he still cared.+

By the end of the day, she managed to drag her limbs into the car park, wanting to get to bed as soon as possible. What she didn't expect to see is Edward, Bella and Jake all stood together.+

Jake was telling Bella, is what Riley had concluded as she observed the trio.+

She gulped when Bella had snapped her head over to her sister, Jake had told Bella that she was there, that wasn't good. She not on her lip as she watches Bella turn her head back to Jake, talking to him quickly before she seemed to storm over to where Riley was, who went to turn away—only for Bella to turn her back.+

"Riley, you could have died" Bella started off, she was looking over her younger sister with worry. "Or hurt, you don't understand what you just threw yourself into, she knows who you are now and now you're in danger"4

"I can handle myself Bella" Riley responded, "and Athena and I had it covered. I worked out where the red head would be within fifteen minutes, the others had to use their smells or Alice's ability to see the future. And she still got away"+

"This isn't your problem Riley" Bella pushed it all away, her sister was her main concern right now. "Riley, I know I wasn't the best sister last year and I'm owning up to that. But you are not getting involved in this battle. I promised mom I'd look after you, and I'm not breaking that promise"1

Riley crossed her arms over as she refused to meet Bella's eyes, the older sister just let out a scoff before she spun around to walk back to where she had left Edward and Jake, who had watched the whole ordeal go down. +

No matter what Bella had said, Riley was going to help, because it was her sister that was in trouble.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"You shouldn't have done that, I would have been fine" Athena grumbled as her cousin, who was half passed out on her bed since they had decided to go to Riley's bedroom.+

"You know I wouldn't" Riley smiled, although it seemed lopsided as her eyes were closed shut as her head was dangling onto the pillow beside her, and Athena watched her cousin sadly.+

"We shouldn't have gone, despite the help, all we've done is piss everyone off" Athena complained , watching her cousin be in such a state seemed to piss her off further and she wanted to heal things with everyone. "Alright, jump on my back, we're going to Emily's"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

Athena had practically forced Riley into something other than pyjamas, so she was being carried by Athena in her leggings and a large jumper that she explained was Jake's. She pushed the door open with a small glare and wandered in, Riley's head tilting slightly as she went, she was definitely asleep right now.+

"Complain later" Athena entered the building with, and the wolves snapped their attention to her, before widening at the sight of an unconscious Riley.+

"What did you do?!" Paul snapped as he stood up abruptly and gathered Riley away from Athena's back and into his arms, carrying her bridal style as her head rolled over to his chest. +

"Nothing! She offered to—she'll be fine after some rest" Athena snapped back at him angrily, annoyed that he assumed that she had harmed Riley.+

"I'll go get a cold cloth, you guys, calm down" Emily wanted the group with a gentle yet stern voice, Sam nodding beside her as he seemed to follow behind her, obviously feeling more attached as their was a wild vampire around.+

"What happened?" Quil questioned as he cleared the sofa for Riley to lie on, and Paul laid the girl down carefully before kneeling next to her and holding her hand in his.+

"I was out of magic and energy, from the other night and the pull of the bond, cause I haven't seen Emmett in a while. And she offered for me to take some energy from her. She'll be fine after she sleeps" Athena informs the others, and watches as Paul lifts his hand up gently to removed hairs from Riley's face. "You guys are dicks for not telling us about Victoria, thankfully Riley is smarter than all of you combined"+

Paul ignored her, his attention remaining on his imprint who was asleep in front of him, he hated lying to her. But the idea of them falling out because of it was even more hurtful, he hates when they were apart.+

"So, we just wait until she's awake then?" Quil spoke up, earning a nod from Athena, who crossed her arms over in a mood.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

"I'm never doing that again" Riley mumbled as her eyes clenched slightly, she felt better but the soreness that Athena had once felt seemed to be attached to her now. "Athena?"+

Her eyes opened up and she realised that she wasn't in her bed anymore, or her house for that matter, she had Paul smiling down softly at her as he brushed her hair and her heart fluttered before she noticed other people.+

"Why am I here?" Riley questioned, moving to sit up, only for Paul to help lift her up and settle her against some pillows that they had grabbed from the guest bedroom, including the blankets.+

"Brought you here to kiss and make up with the wolves" Athena explained with a shrug, ripping another piece of her muffin off before placing it in her mouth. "They're fine now, by the way. I'll patch it up with the Vamps as well"+

"Tell Jasper I'm sorry" Riley did her best pleasing look, ultimately making her look like a kitten, making Paul kiss her cheek randomly, her face flushed. "What was that for?"2

"He wouldn't stop frowning when you were asleep" Emily joked as she entered with a glass of water, holding it out too Riley generously, and she took it with a smile. "How are you feeling, Riles?"+

"Better, much better" Riley grinned, taking a sip off her water before glancing around at everyone. "Warmer than normal"+

"Maybe it would help if Paul wasn't attached to you" Athena grumbled under her breath, shoving another piece of muffin in her mouth. "Your dad thinks your sleeping over at mine, which you are, cause no way am I leaving you with Paul"+

"Don't be mean" Emily warned everyone, giving a pointed look to Athena and Paul, she has enough of their bickering for the last few hours.+

Riley's phone suddenly began to ring, and she picked it up despite the looks that everyone gave her, lifting it up to her ear in confusion. "Bella?"+

"Riley, where are you?"+

"The pack house, why? What's going on?" Riley questioned her sisters worry, listening to her sister let out a sigh of relief on the other end.+

"There's been another vampire in your house, they left your dad alive but they obviously had other intentions" The voice had now switched to Edward, and Riley gasped as she spun her legs off the sofa, reaching to find her shoes as the pack watched her.+

"What do you need me to do?" Riley quizzed, tilting her shoulder to hold the phone against her ear as she put her boots on.+

"We need a wolf, their....sniffing abilities or something?" Bella explained awkwardly, and Riley glanced around at the wolves who could obviously hear in. "Come with them and pack a bag, we're staying with the Cullen's so we can stay safe"1

Paul shook his head from beside Riley, making her sigh. "I'll come with a wolf, and I'll bring Athena cause she needs to make up with Emmett...but I'm going to stay with the wolves tonight"+

"Like Jake?" Bella asked, not liking any of the other wolves, making Riley laugh.+

"Yes, I'll pick him up on the the way" Riley responded quickly, before she ended the call and looked around the room. "Okay, who wants to sniff out a vampire?"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

"Can you smell it?" Riley asked as they stepped foot into her bedroom, and Paul wrinkled his nose before letting out a small sigh, the vampire hadn't come into her room, thankfully.+

"They didn't come into your room" Paul reassures, glancing at Riley who had been watching him closely, before he nudges her into the room. "Pack a bag, we've got a slumber party waiting for you"+

"Thanks for coming with me Paul" Riley smiled at the man, before she pulls out a bag and blushed. "I'll need you to turn around so I can....grab my things"1

Paul nodded with a small smirk etching its way into his face slowly, but he spun around so that she didn't have to see him. He didn't want to scare his imprint or anything, he didn't know how she'd react.+

She quickly pushed away her underwear to the bottom of the bag, hiding it away with a giant hoodie—that she believed belonged to Jake—before she pushed a few more things she thought would be necessary for her stay with the girls, which would be hosted at Sam's, since it's where the boys knew they were all safe together.2

Leah had ultimately rolled her eyes at that one.+

"Riley, I need my spare bag that I keep here" Athena whines as she enters the room, her and Paul sending each a small glare before Riley spins around to her cousin. "I'm staying with Bella, no way would I leave her in a house full of vampires alone"+

"But, you're leaving me alone with wolves?" Riley joked, her cousin shrugged in response, as she knew about the imprint but Riley didn't.+

"I trust Jake" Is what she chose as her response, gaming a nod from Riley as she accepted it, spinning around so she could pick her bag up and rest it on her shoulder.+

"It's under the bed" Riley smiled gently, and Athena drops to the floor near the bed, reaching under and pulling out a suitcase instead, which caused Riley's eyes to widen. "Wait! Not that!"+

Riley jumps onto the lid before it could open, luring out curiosity from the other pair who were in the room, and she mumbles something that they couldn't hear as she clips it back shut. She reaches under to grab the bag herself before she hands it over to Athena, innocent look on her face.11

"What was that?" Athena questioned instantly, and Riley shook her head at her cousin, telling her that she'd explain later.+

Riley picks up the suitcase as well, turning around to face Paul with a smile. He gives her a small one back before he grabs the bag off her shoulder, knowing not to try and touch the suitcase that she seemed to want private, she'd tell if she wants to.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Emily laughed as Leah and Alisha wrestled each other, each one trying to make the other one give in. They tumbled down to the floor, instantly making Kim yelp slightly in surprise and worry, but Emily assured her that they were fine.+

"I want the last...taco!" Alisha growled in her shifter hunger, only for Leah to push her head to the ground, returning a growl in return.+

"No way! You've eaten five!" Leah argued, only to be pushed down again, Riley had a faint smile on her lips knowing that Leah had cracked out of her shell and was making friends—more or less.2

The boys said they should keep a wolf there for safety, and they chose Leah as she was a 'girl'. However, Emily and Riley jumped to the girls defended and stated that she was already invited—as one of the girls, not as a guard—Alisha just jumped after Jared for the stupid comment he made.+

It was okay though, he healed later.+

"Wait" Leah suddenly freezes in her place, Alisha doing the same as she glanced around the room place, as if trying to find something. "I smell her"+

"The leech?" Kim's voice rises, her hand holding on to Emily's tightly, as the woman gestures for them all to get closer. +

"We need to get the boys" Emily spoke quickly, before they all heard a whooshing motion, and Leah's head snapped towards the front door.+

"I'll shift, Alisha, stay here and on guard" Leah spoke with authority quickly, before she ran outside the door, the sound of ripping clothes reached the girls ears.+

"I'm not sitting around" Riley suddenly spoke, reaching for her suitcase and she flipped it open, while the girls gasped at the contents. Riley shuffled through it and handed Kim a small gun, whilst Emily had a taser. "Hopefully it won't come to it, I'm going to help Leah"7

"You can't" Emily shook her head quickly, Kim whimpering as her eyes were staring widely at the gun in her hands.+

"I can" Riley sent the older woman a smile, pulling out another weapon, which seemed to be some kind of crossbow. "I'm much more better with hand to hand combat, but this one likes her running games"1

Riley didn't say much more, telling the girls to stay safe before she set off to stand outside, looking for her friend that she couldn't abandon. +

The wind was certainly higher than it usually was, which usually gestured that something was going to happen, something dramatic. Riley didn't like the idea of that. She suddenly wanted to be back at home, hiding under her favourite blanket from Sarah, she felt safe there.+

But she couldn't sit back and have something happen to Leah.+

"Leah?" Riley whispered, before she heard a whooshing motion nearby her, and she shot her crossbow behind her, the stops being caught by the red hairs vampire that they had all been hunting a few days before.+

Riley's breathing hitched slightly as she met the gruesome Blood Red eyes that she seemed to be enjoying so much, her lips were taunting as she smirked at the small human, probably thinking her to be foolish. Riley almost laughed at the struggle that the whole hunt had caused them before, it didn't seem like that much effort now.+

"You missed" Her voice unwillingly sent chills down Riley's spine, and Riley shook it off before letting a smile play on her lips.2

"I know, but now they know where you are" 4

And at that, there was a loud growl, before a huge black wolf came running into the opening they seemed to be standing in. The red head flared at the girl, before she ran off, the pack chasing closely behind her.+

Riley let out a shaky breathe as she finally lowered her crossbow, she was in for an earful.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Emily had nearly sobbed when Riley returned with the boys, crying out as she spotted the girl safe, she had dropped the taser quickly before dragging the girl into her arms. Only to be gently pushed away by Sam, who took his imprint in his arms, hugging her closely as he breathed in her scent, confirming her safety to not only him, but his wolf. +

Jared had Kim in his arms instantly, questioning the gun in her hands lowly as she began to explain everything that went on, and how scared she was without him there to face the vampire.2

To say the others weren't as happy was an understatement, thank God they sent a few of them home.+

"What were you thinking?!" Paul yelled at his imprint, his worry had washed away as he finally came to terms with how stupid she had been, in the woods alone with a vampire.3

"I was thinking of helping my friend, I shouldn't have to sit back and let you handle everything. Why else do you think that I've been training?" Riley was livid, her cousin was involved, her friends and even her human sister....so why couldn't she help out her friends in staying alive?+

"Training?! You think training is going to help you against that?! Do you even realise how stupid you were being!!"  Paul argued back, his body not even bothering to shake as the anger cored from somewhere else.+

"Yes! I shot the arrow so you guys knew she was here! And it worked! We're all safe! Who cares if I had gotten hurt?! I'm fine!" +

"Who cares—??!" Paul had to do a double take at that, "God Riley, I almost lost you! You could have died!"8

"What does it matter to you?! Everyone would have been safe, it was better for me to go out and help, who knows what could have happened!" Riley remained in her place, she wasn't going to let herself get talked out of it.+

"If you die...a part of me does too! You're my freaking imprint Riley! Do you even understand what you did?!" 7

"Your what..?" Riley's voice broke the tension as she stopped yelling, her body relaxing as she spoke with confusion, she was his imprint? Why hasn't he done anything about it? Did he not want them to be anything? Maybe he was trying to break it. Her thoughts were racing as her body neglected her breathing abilities and her temperature dropped drastically from the heated movement she before.+

The pack seemed to be on the wait to see how she would react to the news that Paul had mistakenly let loose, but she seemed to be frozen there.+

"What the hell, Lahote" Leah snapped, stepping forward and pushing the boy out of the way as she gently placed her hands on Riley's shoulders as if pressing too hard or too fast would trigger Riley. "Ri?"1

Riley's eyes fluttered slightly as her body become limp, exhausted taking over her as well as shock, and Leah quickly caught her waist, preventing her from falling down to the floor. Leah glared at Paul as she picked up Riley into her arms, shocked by how the girl was lighter than she seemed.3

"Oh dear" Emily states sadly, walking over to help Leah. "We'll take her to the guest room. Sam, I think it's best if everyone goes home, It's been too much for one night"1

Sam nodded in agreement with his fiancé, before he nodded his head towards the door, silently telling the others to leave.+

"Can you stay at mine, Jared?" Kim's scared voice asked, and his eyes softened as his imprint. It was her first slumber party and it had been ruined by that vampire.+

"Of course" He responded, grabbing his hand and leading her out of the house, not bothering to say bye as his main concern was Kim.+

"I'll head over to Jake's, he usually is making a snack at this time" Alisha stated awkwardly as she glanced between the alpha and Paul, and she silently nodded to herself before she walked away.+

"You can either stay on the couch or on a chair in the guest room." Sam offered to Paul, knowing he wasn't going to leave, and Paul nodded quickly, walking off down the hallway towards his imprint.3


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley's eyes seemed to open on their own, her eyes adjusting slightly as she took in her surroundings, it was defiantly early morning as it was still dark and she could tell that she was still at Emily's house. Her eyes scanned the lovely woodland themed room before her hazel eyes landed on the sleeping figure beside her.+

Her cheeks flushed as she remembered what had happened the night prior, she had stood her ground, only to find out that she was his imprint in the heat of the moment.+

She could remember all the tale's that Sarah used to describe to her, about how from day 1 (when their eyes usually met) nothing was ever the same, the imprint became the centre of their universe and they physically couldn't part with them. Riley remembers that she had asked Sarah if she had one, and Sarah's gave her a small teasing look, saying 'just don't ask Billy though, he won't want you to know these things' .+

Billy had imprinted on Sarah, is what Riley had deduced as she watched the couple closely. She was curious when she was younger, the whole world seems different to her than her sister. Riley had forced Sarah to tell the tale on how Billy and Sarah met, before she claimed that she wanted an imprint.+

'It doesn't work that way, my little wonder' Sarah's responded softly, a smile on her lips. 'You see, you can chose if you want to be their friend, their protected, or even their lover.+

Riley hadn't thought it was gross like other kids, instead her eyes grew wider as she got excited. To even have a possibility like Sarah.+

Her hand fell down to Paul's sleeping head automatically, and she gently brushed her hand over his hair, smiling softly down at him.+

The boy shifted underneath her hand, which she quickly snatched away as she blushed, but he rested his head on top of his arm on the bed, smiling up at her gently. "I liked that"+

Riley nodded slightly before she returns her hand to his hair, brushing it lightly with her fingers as she tried to ignore the state he was setting her in. But, eventually he pushed her hand off and took it in his hand, holding it up to his lips so he could place a chaste kiss to it.+

"What are you doing?" Riley asked, trying to make her voice sound as normal as possible, this had to be one of the most tense moments she had ever been in and Paul looked completely calm.+

Paul was actually freaking out, she hadn't exactly said anything about the imprint bond, but she wasn't screaming at him, pushing him away from her. The mere thought of that possibly happening made his heart ache, which is what caused him to grab her hand and kiss it. He smiled at her shyness, happy that she was as effected as him.+

"Kissing my imprint's hand" He responded, not holding back from why she had fainted in the first place.+

"I heard right then" Riley's tone was unrecognisable, and Paul inwardly freaked out even further, the other imprints had much bigger responses than that. Where and what could he even do??+

"An imprint doesn't have to be anything romantic or anything—"He went to cover up, only for Riley to place her hand on his mouth quickly, sending him a small look before she moved it.+

"I know, Sarah explained when I was younger" Riley smiled fondly, and Paul suddenly wanted to slap Jake for not giving him a heads up that she already knew what an imprint was. "And I know I have a choice as to what we can be. But I want to know what you would want as well. T-then it's fair?"1

Paul smiled at her, he couldn't help it as she just seems so adorable in that moment. "I would want us to be lovers, but I'm not going to push you into anything"+

"C-can we..." Riley gulped slightly, bringing herself back together as Paul watched her intently. "Can we...work our way up?"+

Paul was content with that answer, he immediately filled with happiness, leaning forward to kiss her blushing cheeks before he grabbed both her hands, that fit together like a perfect puzzle. "You won't regret it, I promise"+

"I know" Riley nodded slightly, before a yawn escaped her and Paul switched to concerned.+

"You need to sleep" Paul removed his hands from hers and rested them against her shoulders, pushing her back against the pillows gently, pulling the blankets up so she wouldn't get cold.+

"Do you wanna stay on the bed too?" Riley asked, and Paul froze, not really knowing what she wanted. "I don't want you to stay on the chair, and I feel like I want you close"+

Paul smiled down at her, before he climbed in beside her, making sure he was on top of the covers so he didn't push it too far. Riley quickly moved over to him, relishing in his warmth, and he lowered his arm around her waist, her head tucking itself under his chin as they both closed their eyes to catch up on the sleep they had missed.8


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Whoops, there goes her innocence" A voice commented in a snicker, as Riley shifted her head slightly, refusing to let the sunlight get to her, she moved closer to the source of warmth and attempted to fall asleep all over again.1

"Not like she's stand a chance anyway, she is Paul's imprint" another voice chipped in, only to be slapped on the arm sharply. "Ow!"8

"She might not know what it means yet! Keep your voice down! I'm trying to take photos so I can blackmail him" +

"Guys, we shouldn't be in here"+

"Embry, shut up, you're ruining my focus!" +

"Shh"+

Riley clenched her eyes together one more time in denial, before she felt hands, that had unknowingly been around her waist, lift up so they were holding her body from her back and then there was a low growl from the warmth that had been holding on to her.+

"If you'd wake her up, I'll kill all of you" A deep voice from sleep spoke, and Riley gained butterfly's in her stomach as she shivered slightly at Paul's tone.6

"They already woke me up" Riley responded, and it caused all eyes to snap down at her tiny figure, hail Paul let out an angry huff as he glared at the guys. "It's okay, it was time to get up anyway"+

Riley pushes away Paul's arm and jumps out of the bed, flashing all the guys a kind smile, even if they had woken her up. "Had Emily finished cooking breakfast yet?"+

"No" Jake answers, stopping from glaring at Paul as he turns to his best friend, gifting her an innocent look when she sends him a questioning one. "Why? You hungry?"+

"Yes, but I want to help"2


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley returned home after breakfast, having to shove Paul away because he wasn't allowed past the treaty line, she had smiled at him as she shook her head.1

It took everything in him to not drag her away from where the vampires would constantly be visiting, the thought alone made something crawl over his skin and he randomly got waves of anger from himself, he had to remind himself that they wouldn't hurt her.+

Riley simply smiled and kissed his cheek goodbye before she entered her house and sighed lightly, knowing she wouldn't be able to get everything off of her mind.+

"Hi, Riles. How was the sleepover?" Her father asked from the loving room, and Riley sent him a kind smile as she moved so to sit next to him.+

"It was fun, as usual" She lied to the best of her abilities, it was fun....before the whole vampire trying to eat all the girls thing, but the pros seemed to be higher on this scale.+

"Are you all ready for graduation next week?" Charlie asked his youngest daughter, and Riley suddenly faltered her smile slightly at the question.+

She was finishing school earlier, and she was glad because it meant that she'd have less stress on her while her sister and cousin were constantly fighting off vampires, not forgetting about her wolf family, of course.+

"Yes, it's time to tackle the next stage in my life" Was all she said, a smile tinted her lips again, she had decided not to go to college but to instead start volunteering at the Hospital, she wanted to help out with some of the kids there and Dr.Cullen said he's be glad to put in a good word for her.+

"Unfortunately for me" Her dad sighed, and she looked at him with empathetic eyes before she dived forward to hug him, he awkwardly returned the favour.+

"No matter what, you'll always be my dad and I may grow up, but I will always need you"11


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

"When we were five, they asked us what we wanted to be when we grew up. Our answers were things like: astronaut, president or in my case a princess" Jessica spoke through the mic, everyone watching her as they glanced at each other with smiles occasionally, Riley was holding on to Bella and Jaspers hands, barely maintaining her excitement. There was a laugh from some of the parents and carers who came to watch the year graduate. "When we were ten they asked us again, we answered: rock star, cowboy or in my case a golden medalist. But now that we've grown up, they want a serious answer. Well, how bout this. Who the hell knows?"5

Everyone began to laugh and cheer for the girl, Riley clapping as she let go of her sister and friends hand, and she exchanged a smile with Athena, who was sat next to Emmett.+

"This isn't the time to make hard and fast decisions, this is the time to make mistakes. Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere, fall in love, a lot." She continued, and some couples started to smile to themselves as they thought of a few memories or people. "Major in philosophy, because there's no way to make a career out of that. Change your mind and change it again because nothings permanent. So, make as many mistakes as you can. That way someday when they may ask what we want to be, we won't have to guess, we'll know"3

Claps surrounded the hall as everyone began to cheer for the speech, some people even standing up or whistling, Riley exchanged a wide smile with Jasper as she was one of the few who stood up to clap for the girl.+

"We will now start to call the names" The principal stated after he had stopped clapping, and then he began to read them out. "Abigail...."1

(Skip to our people...)1

"Bella Swan" He read out as Bella walked onto the stage quite awkwardly, grabbing her certificate before she shook their hands and walked off, people cheering for her as she sent them a small wave. "Riley Swan"+

Riley pushed aside any sign of being a Swan and walked onto the stage with a big smile, waving at her dad when she spotted him, and she smiled even wider when she noticed a few of the pack members standing up to cheer for her. She grabbed the certificate and shook their hands, holding it up proudly as she started to walk off the stage.8

"Angel Taylor..."1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I graduated!" Riley announced happily as she ran towards her dad, wrapping her arms around him as she reached him, and he held on to her just as tight, part of him wanting to see if it was real. She soon pulled back with her usual smile on her face. "I actually graduated! And I didn't trip on the stage in these heels that Alice gave me!"+

"Good job Riles, I couldn't have done that" Bella admits as she appears beside the girl, Edward on her arm, Riley just grinned at the pair.+

"I have some other people to say hi to" Riley suddenly spoke as she spotted the group who stood back from everyone, many people were giving them suspicious looks. "Be back soon!"+

She ran off to the pack, jumping into Paul's arms immediately, and he gave her a small spin so she could let out her adorable laugh, before he placed her down and kissed her cheek. "Well done, Riley. You did amazing"4

"And I didn't trip" She added with a smile, before she was pulled into another hug, and she let out a playful squeal. "Jacob! I need my arms!"+

"Me next!" Leah joked, and Riley jumped into her arms with more enthusiasm than the boys. "See that Lahote? Mine, you owe Jared ten bucks"13

"And I owe Embry" Jake groaned, and Riley had to give Leah props for dealing with these two for all that time. +

"Thanks guys, I didn't know that you were coming" The smile on Riley's face was plastered there as she pulled back to look at the three.+

"More of us wanted to come, but we were only allowed a certain amount because of the treaty and such" Jake explained shortly, and Riley's smiles faltered at that.3

"But, let's not ruin your day" Leah states as she elbows Jake's ribs, causing him to cringe at the pain.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            31

"You're right, it's certainly not the sort of place that I should be" Riley muses as she sat on the corner, everyone else dancing and chatting lively as she hid away while on her phone. "But, at least I'm being somewhat supportive to Bella, that's all that matters"+

"No" The other end spoke in annoyance, "what matters right now is you just finished high school and you're hiding in a corner. I'm coming to get you"+

"Paul, I'm fine. Seriously, I'm sure Jasper is around here somewhere..." Riley mumbled the end but to herself, glancing around the room for the sight of a Cullen, she only found Athena consuming a concerning amount of alcohol. "Definitely not my scene"+

"I'm coming to get you" Paul simply stated, before he seems to argue with someone on the other end, but Riley could only hear a woman's voice and his, she waited patiently as she tapped her foot to the beat of the music. "Okay, Me and Alisha are coming to get you"+

"Alisha and I" Riley corrected, before her eyebrows furrowed in confusion. "Why is Alisha coming?"4

"Her excuse was that I should come with back up, but I think she secretly wants to see that Cullen guy" Paul responded smartly, before there was a loud slap on the other. "Emily!"+

Riley let out a laugh into the phone as she shook her head at the boy, "Okay, I'll tell Jas that you're on your way with Alisha"+

"I'm keeping you on the phone, if you think I'm going to end the call because I've got to drive...you're mistaken" +

Riley just rolled her eyes in response, "you really should—"+

She cut herself off as she saw the commotion happening near the main stairs, firstly was the fact that Jake, Embry and Quil were here together and the second thing was that Alice was having a vision.+

"Riley?? Ri???" Riley heard it loudly from her phone and she realised that she dropped her arm at the scene, she swiftly bright her phone back to her ear. +

"Paul, you need to get here quickly, Alice had another vision, and it doesn't look good at all"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley had her arms crossed over in front of her stomach, feeling unsettled by the whole ordeal as everyone read surrounded around a random room, Jasper's arm was around her shoulder as he used his empathetic abilities on her, somewhat charming her around as Alice explained her visions to the group.+

"They'll be here in four days" Alice added on afterwards, her eyes scanning around the group.+

"This could turn into a blood bath" Carlisle stated as he leaned back onto the window ledge that Bella and Edward were currently sitting on.2

"Who behind this?" Edward questions, his eyes turning up to face Alice, who was holding onto her mate tightly.+

"I didn't see anyone I recognised" Alice concludes, secretly saying it want any of their current enemies. "Maybe one"+

Edward perks up in his place, "I know his face, he's local, Riley Bears. He didn't start this"+

"Whoever did is staying out of the action" Alice responds, and Riley nods in agreement as Jasper's grip improves as he tenses up, she grabs his hand to comfort him.+

"It must be playing with the blind spots in your vision" Carlisle adds, which annoys a few of the members.+

"It has to be Victoria, she's the only one that's played around with it before" Riley concludes, her arms shifting around slightly at the tension in the room, Jasper nods silently.+

"Either way, the army is coming and there aren't enough of us to protect the town" Jasper says, and Jacob glances at him alongside Athena.+

"Count me in" Athena nods, "I'll be able to bring them down and start a few fires"+

"Me too, with a little training, of course..." Riley mumbles the ending part to Jasper, who sends her a small smile of acknowledgement. 1

"Hold up, what damn army" Jacob cuts in, sending a small look to Riley, to say he doesn't agree that she should play a part in it, which causes her to silently huff at him.+

"New borns, our kind" Carlisle answers shortly.+

"What are they after?" Embry asks, and Riley sinks on to Jasper's arms slightly as he glanced at her.+

"They were passing around Bella's scent, a red blouse" Alice says, and Athena's eyebrows furrowed slightly.+

"That was my shirt, they stole my shirt for Bella's scent?" Athena quizzes, shooting a small glare to Bella.1

"Not the time" Riley states lowly to Athena, who shakes her head.+

"Either way, they better return it, it costs thirty bucks" Athena pouts slightly, and Emmett wraps his arm around her waist and tugs her back slightly, telling her to calm down.1

"They're after Bella? What the hell does this mean?" Jake asks.+

"It means an ugly fight, with lives lost" +

"Alright, we're in" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Alright, we're in" +

"No" Bella states sharply as Riley lets out a loud 'what!'. And Bella turns her head to face Jacob just as the door opens randomly, causing the group to look over in a panic.+

"Paul" Riley breathed out when she spots him, and she runs out of Jasper's arm to jump into Paul's, and he catches her instantly and holds her close to his body, his hands going around her shoulders as she hugs his waist.+

"What's going on?" Alisha questions as she notices the tension, and she avoids eye contact with Jasper, even though she was stood there in just a cropped jacket and some denim shorts.+

"Catch you up later" Jacob responds shortly, and she gives him a nod. +

"You'll get yourselves killed, no way" Bella continues with the conversion, her eyes flickering away from her sister and Paul, turning to face Jacob again.+

"I wasn't asking for permission" Jake says, battling any instinct to agree with one of his closest friends, but the he thought of the danger they would all be in if the wolves didn't fight. +

"Would Sam even agree to this?" Riley cuts in, appearing beside Jasper again with Paul's arm around her waist as she played with his fingers. Alisha was glancing at Jasper, who couldn't seem to look away from her. "I mean, I know everyone would be safer, including Bella, but Sam would have to approve"+

"Jacob, do you think Sam would agree to...an understanding" Carlisle asked carefully, glancing between the wolves.+

"As long as we get to kill some vampires" Paul adds, and Riley seats his hand as she realised that he was thinking of killing the Cullen's. +

"Jasper?" Carlisle silently asks him a question.+

"They'll give us the numbers, new borns won't even know they'll exist, they'll give us an edge" Jasper responds carefully, removing his eyes away from Alisha as he turns back to his adoptive father.+

"Plus, they don't know you have a warlock and a hunter in training" Riley grins from her place beside Alisha and Paul squeezes her waist slightly, silently saying that he'd be arguing with her about it later. 15

"We'll need to co-ordinate" Carlisle states, standing up from his place, and Bella shakes her head quickly.+

"Carlisle, they're going to get hurt" Bella rejects, but Carlisle continues anyway.+

"We'll all need some training, fighting new borns requires knowledge like Jasper's. You're welcome to join us" Carlisle offers to Jake, who nods wordlessly.+

"Alright, name the time and place" Jake responds, stepping forward to Carlisle.+

"Jake, you don't know what you're getting yourself into, this is dangerous" It was Athena's time to interrupt from beside Emmett, Riley knew it was pointless, if there was one thing she knew about the wolves, it was that they were stubborn to the core.+

"This is what we do, besides, we're getting along, that's what you wanted, right?" Jake asks, sending a short look over to Bella, who opens her mouth slightly in shock.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"An army?" Emily questions in shock, placing her hand on her chest as she thought of any of the boys and girls being hurt in the battle.+

"They've named a time and place for us to train with them" Jake offers to Sam, who was stood taking in all the information, Riley nods from beside Alisha.+

"Jasper had fought and trained new borns before, he'll be the one teaching the others" She adds on, remembering Jasper's story, and she winced slightly. "That's gonna being up some tough memories for him, but I'll be there to learn and help anyway"+

"You're going?" Emily quizzes in further shock, taking a step back slightly.+

"No, she's not" Paul refuses, and Riley sends him a short look.+

"Yes, she is"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley giggles to herself as she watches Emmett get thrown the ground so easily, and the guy only seemed to get even more angry as he stood up sharply and spun around to face Jasper again. "Again"+

Athena laughed as they turned to start fighting again, Riley stood next to her with a smile on her face, having seen them move easily as Athena had tested a spell on her that would able her to keep up with supernatural speed, it would certainly make fighting easier.+

The jeep pulled up in that moment and the fight was over as everyone turned their full attention to Bella and Edward who had arrived.+

"When did you two get here?" Bella asked her sister and cousin, who were stood on the sideline with their active give on. 1

"This morning, Riley had some training" Athena explained quickly, and Bella nodded short as Riley sent her a huge wave and smile. "And I just wanted to see if my new spells were working"+

Everyone then turned their attention to a hill, where the moves slowly revealed themselves one by one, it was a strange moment seeing as they hadn't been on each other's territories in hundreds of years.+

"Hi" Riley sent them all a grin, waving at them as Athena shook her head beside her. Some of the wolves were not happy to see that Riley had come.+

"They don't trust us enough to be in their human forms" Edward turned to Bella and his adoptive father, as nobody returned Riley's excitement.+

"They came, that's all that matters, will you translate?" Carlisle asks before he walks over slightly so he's in front of the wolves, Riley took a step forward as well, to be there just in case. "Welcome, Jasper has experience with new borns, how to defeat them."+

"They wanna know how the new borns are different from us" Edward translated, and Riley almost wanted to scoff as she had had a rampage about it not being written in the book and how it was ridiculous as they were more dangerous, and she did that while they were on the beach for a picnic that Emily made.+

"They're a great deal stronger than us, because their own human blood still lingers in their tissues. Our kind is never more physically powerful, than in our first seven months of this life" He then nodded over to Jasper, who took control over the situation as he stepped next to Riley, making Paul and Alisha uneasy.1

"Carlisle is right, that's why they were created, the new born army doesn't need thousands like a human army and no human army could stand against them." Jasper states as he glanced at the wolves, seeming in pain more than often, Riley grabs his hand to comfort him silently, making Paul huff out. "Now the two most important things to remember are first: never let them get their arms around you, they would crush you instantly. And second: Never go for the obvious kill, they'll be expecting that and you will loose. Emmett"+

He calls on his brother as he pulls his hand away from Riley and steps towards where they were previously fighting, and Riley let's put a grin as she steps back again, awaiting the fighting.+

"Don't hold back"+

"Not in my nature" Emmett responds with a smirk, and Athena lets out a scoff from the side, causing Riley to giggle.+

Emmett runs towards Jasper, pushing him harshly through the dirt and soil before he spins him upwards and throws him over his shoulders, causing him to land where he was previously stood, but Jasper easily bounces back and runs towards Emmett.+

Emmett runs towards him at the same time, Riley's eyes keeping up with the sharply as they use their vampire speed. Emmett goes for the punch, only to be dodged by Jasper, who sends a shape punch to his chest, sending Emmett straight to the ground.+

"Never loose focus" Jasper states, a smirk etching onto his face lightly as he looks down at his brother. +

Next up was Edward and Carlisle, which would be tricky because Carlisle is older and more experienced as Edward was the fastest vampire out of the lot of them.+

But after they had collided several times and sent a few swings, Jasper observing them slowly as Edward thought he had the upper hand as he got Carlisle to the ground, smiling smugly.+

"One more thing" he pauses, as Carlisle jumps up and tackles Edward to the floor. "Never turn your back on your enemy. Rosalie?"+

"Five on Rosalie" Athena bets from beside her cousin, her sends her a small grins as the blonde walks over to Jasper on the large 'fighting area' they had laid out. +

"You're on" Riley agreed, turning back to the pair of vampires, Rosalie immediately went for swinging at him harshly, he dodged as meant as he could before he had her in an easy place to hit her to the ground.+

"Riley?" Jasper turned to the brunette who was smugly looking at Athena as she won the bet, the wolves let out a bunch of growls as they heard her name being called, but she ignored them.1

"If I win, you owe me a pizza" Riley counters as starts to walk forwards, gaining an encouraging pat on the shoulder from Athena, she lets out a nervous sigh when she's facing Jasper. "Wow, this is a lot of pressure here"+

"Just try your best" Jasper offered a small support, before his face turned serious and she gave into her 'Hunter' side, her face washing away any happiness which was unusual for everyone to see. +

"Come on then" Riley scoffed, before he began to run towards her, she sharply turned her body to the side and caught his arm that he swung towards her after juicing her move, before she dropped it and jumped backwards as he sent out a kick.+

Riley landed on her feet and a hand on the floor, huffing at the piece of hair that got in her face before she ran forwards to the best of her ability, Jasper going to dodge a punch, but she dived down and tackled his feet, bringing him to the floor.7

He grabbed her leg and pried her off quickly before he stood up again, pushing her backwards so she rolled quickly, and everyone winced as they heard her slam against a tree.+

Riley let out a small groan as she stood up again, rolling her shoulders before she met Jasper's gaze again and ran towards him, but he hadn't expected her to get up, so when she tackles his legs again, he fell to the ground, with her legs catching his arms so her couldn't move.+

"Never turn your back on your enemy" Riley mocked, before she let go and let her body chill out on the floor with exhaustion.11


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Last night before the fight and you chose to spend it here?" Emily questions with a light smile as she opens up the front door to Riley, who actually knocks unlike everybody else who visits the house. +

Riley smiled up at the scared yet beautiful woman before her, "well, I wasn't about to leave you alone with Sam. Plus, I'd rather be here than listen to any sad stories about the Cullen's, I already know them all anyway"+

Emily smiled gently before she opened up the door fully to the short brunette, who took the invitation and entered the warm home, wether it was Emily's cooking or the pack that was always there—the house always seemed warm even though the weather was bitter.+

"Okay, how did you know I'd be here?" Riley asks with a smile on her lips as she spots Paul sat down at the kitchen table with Sam, they had seemed to be awaiting for her arrival.+

"You're not staying here, I've got somewhere else for us to go" Paul stood up from his place, sending his imprint a smile, who in return looked baffled.2

"Somewhere else?" Riley questioned, but when she looked at Emily, the woman just gave her an innocent look. "Okay....it's better if we leave Emily and Sam to have some time alone anyway"1

Emily then looked at Riley sadly, before she dragged the girl into her arms, her head resting on Riley's shoulder, who was hugging her back just as tight. "Please be careful tomorrow"+

"Of course" Riley promised, squeezing her eyes momentarily. "I'll even drag the boys back safely, the elders know that they'll try and do something dumb"+

Emily let out a laugh at that before she pulled back from the girl and wiped away a stray cheek, walking backwards until she was in Sam's arms, who held her to him as he hated seeing her sad.+

"Let's go then" Riley nods over to Paul, her hand gripping her bag tightly as she sends Sam and Emily a small wave, saying that she'd see them later.+

Paul held Riley's hand in his gently as he began to walk them out of the house and towards where he had parked his car (which was in a place where Riley didn't spot it). "Where exactly are we going?"+

"My place"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

"You're house is so small and cute" Riley complimented as she stared at the small yet cute lodge-like house, Paul closing the car door that he had opened for her, she sent him a smile in return. "How come we always hang out at my house, yours is so...secluded and peaceful"+

"Because I'm always at the pack house, or on patrol" Paul answers quickly, "besides, I don't want people to get the wrong impression by you coming over to my house all the time"2

"Still, we should hang out here, there would be nobody interrupting our movies" Riley grins.1

Paul just rolls his eyes playfully before he holds his hand out to her, which she gladly accepts and allows him to lead her into the house, and she gasped when she noticed the pictures of Paul as a child.+

"You're adorable" Riley squeals as she runs over to the baby picture on the coffee table, and she holds it with both of her hands as she smiles down on it, Paul just watched her from the sidelines.+

Riley places down the photo before she spots another one, Paul on the beach at the age of around seven, proudly smiling as he holds up a tooth that had been knocked out. "So cute"1

"Thanks" Paul smirks, but she ignored him as she placed it down and moved on to the next picture, one of him and his mother.+

From what Riley knew, they didn't like the woman as she had abandoned Paul with his abusive father at a young age, she didn't understand how any mother could do that to her children. 1

She changed the subject when Paul noticed what she was looking at, "if I have a kid, I hope it's just as cute as you were"+

"If we have a kid, I hope they turn out innocent like you, especially if it's a girl" Paul responds with a grin, reaching forward and holding Riley's hands, who sends him a countering look.2

"No, I think if she has your looks, she'll be a heart breaker" Riley grins cheekily, before she tugs her hand away and sticks her tongue out. "And I'll tell her, not to tell her father about it"+

"You wouldn't" Paul counters, as he sticks his finger out as a warning.+

"I would, and I'd let her walk around in a skirt and cropped top" Riley teases, and Paul chooses that moment to pounce towards her, causing her to let out a squeal as he pushes her to the ground, his hand supporting her waist and head so she didn't get hurt as they reach the floor. "Not fair, you've got wolf—powers"3

"I think you mean shifter powers" Paul states, mocking the many times where she corrected the pack on their terminology, she rolls her eyes at him playfully.+

"Whatever" Riley scoffed at him in a playful manner, before she meets his eyes again and her breathe hitches slightly, she just realised what kind of position they were in. +

"I want to kiss you" Paul let's out lowly, his voice in a slight whisper as he looked down into her hazel eyes that seemed to have him gripped, and her heart takes that moment to stammer. "But I don't want to force you into anything"15

"I want you to" Riley whispers back, before she reaches forward and grabs his cheeks gently, tugging his head down to her lips quickly in a rush of the moment.+

Their lips finally collide and they both let out a sigh at the contact, as if it was a moment they had been waiting for, for years on end. Paul gently caresses Riley's waist that he had ahold of, brushing it where it causes a shiver to pass over her body.+

Riley's hands travels away from his cheeks towards his neck, travelling on natural instinct as she hadn't done anything like this before. But Paul was still effected unlike any other kiss he had had before.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Can't believe I got benched" Riley grumbled as she was carried by Seth, who was holding her in his arms, even after Paul had sent him several threats to keep his hands in safe-zones. 8

"At least we're benched together?" Seth added on with a comforting smile, nod Riley returned it softly before her head fell against Seth's shoulder as she let out a sigh.3

"I hope Edward and Jacob didn't kill each other, even though Jake—Jake isn't interested in Bella anymore, the two are quite temperamental" Riley's heart skipped a beat as she almost gave it away that Jacob had imprinted on someone else, only her and Athena knew about it.3

"I'm sure Bella kept them apart" Seth responded, and Riley let out a short nod in return, there was no way Bella could keep a shifter and vampire to stop trying to murder each other.+

Nothing could.+

"We're here" Seth chimes as they reached the very miserable and cold campsite, and he lets Riley down slowly, letting her balance her feet properly after not being on them for some time.+

Riley smiled at the group, who actually seemed to be getting along for once. "Glad to see nobody died"+

Edward stifled a laugh as Bella sent her a stern look, telling her silently that now wasn't the time, Riley just sent a thumbs up before she looked at her best friend.+

"Oh God" Jake breathed out with a smile before he dragged the girl with sad eyes into his arms, she was dressed up in black attire, making her look like the whole 'Hunter' image she was trying to achieve, but she still couldn't help but look innocent. 2

"Be careful" Riley states against Jake's chest, and the boy nods against the tip of her head.+

"Jake" Seth calls out his name, and the pair separated sadly. +

Jake then runs off the campsite and towards the battle grounds, Seth pointing over to some trees, saying he was going to be changing quickly and do a lap around to make sure the area is safe.+

"Are you all ready?" Bella asked carefully, seeing the weapons that her younger sister was holding in some straps.+

"It's starting" Edward suddenly says, Seth jumps out of the bush in his wolf form, watching as the vampire stares off in the distance, obviously watching the fight going down. "Jacob just got there....he's good"+

Riley let out a breathe of somewhat relief, it was still going on and she was worried for the family that she had formed with these people, letting any one of them leave this morning was tough enough, never mind all of them.+

"Emmett just save Paul" Edward speaks with a faint smile on his lips, and Riley was internally celebrating before she could hear a small snap somewhere in the distance, and her eyes snapped over to some trees, Edward soon looking as well. +

"Is someone hurt?" Bella asks quickly, and Riley holds up a sharp blade as she takes her position.+

"She's close" Edward answers, turning his guard on immediately. "I can hear her thoughts, Seth, go"+

Seth runs off into the bushes as Riley steps towards Bella, who hangs beside Edward, holding on to his arm. Riley begins to speak carefully as she glanced around. "She knew we weren't there, she got Edward's scent" +

"She knew you'd be with me" Edward adds on, before he looks slightly conflicted at something. +

"She found us" Bella states, glancing uneasily at her sister who was holding on to a blade.+

"She's not alone"+

The trio watched as the 'missing teen' revealed himself, walking sickly through the pure and white snow as he had his eyes locked onto Bella, who turned even more behind Edward who was taking his stand.+

"Riley, listen to me. Victoria is just using you, to distract me, she knows I'll kill you." Edward try's to show Riley the truth, but then a loud slam fills their ears and Bella and Riley snap their attention over to Victoria, who perched on a tree. "In fact, she'd be glad that she doesn't have to deal with you anymore"5

"Don't listen, Riley, I told you about their mind tricks" Victoria speaks to him carefully, causing girl Riley to scoff at her.2

"They don't have mind control, clearly Victoria hasn't explained very thing, otherwise you'd know there are others ways to loving this life" Girl Riley responded smartly, only for Victoria to send her a low hiss.1

"I can read her mind, so I know what she thinks of you." Edward continued, as the boy looks between them all carefully.+

"He's lying to you" Victoria states softly.+

"She only created you and this army to avenge her true mate, James, that's the only thing she cares about. Not you." Edward's words causes the boy to turn to Victoria, as though a part of him truly doesn't trust her.+

"There's only you, you know that" +

"Think about it, your from Forks, you know the area. It's the only reason she chose you" Edwards mind reading only seemed to anger the boy at this point, which Riley noticed as her grip tightened on her blade. "She doesn't love you"+

"Riley, don't let him do this to us. You know I love you" Victoria says to the boy, who watches her closely before he looks down to the snow with a clenched jaw, looking up and meeting Edward's eyes with nothing but hatred.+

"You're dead" He states, smiling slightly like a crazy person, and Riley resisted the urge to state that three of them there were technically dead already.6

He went to step towards them, only for Seth to let out a giant growl and jump forwards, biting down in the guys hand as he landed on the snow, having pulled the boy away from the rest, before he fully bit off Riley's hand—Causing the boy to let out a painful scream.1

Victoria immediately goes to run, but Edward beats her as he shouts out at her. "You won't get another chance like this again, you want her, you want me to feel the pain you felt when I killed James. When I tore him, to pieces...when I turned him to ash...when I turned him..into nothing"+

As Victoria tackled Edward down the ground, Riley spun around to her sister, holding out her blade quickly. "Use this is necessary, I'm going to help Seth with the disgrace of all Riley's"2

With that, she ran off towards where Seth had been tackling the vampire, where she quickly leaped forward and pushed the vampire away from her friend, letting out a small smirk as she landed, her eyes meeting with the angered vampire who'd been pushed.+

The vampire ran forward after Riley, only to be thrown into a tree by Seth, and Riley quickly realised that the vampire wasn't good at taking on two at a time, which she nodded over to Seth as he picked up on it too.+

The pair went in two different ways around the vampire, Seth gripping the vampires shoulder as Riley got his legs, sending the vampire down to the ground as Seth fought to keep him there.+

"Hold still!" Riley shouted, grabbing onto the vampires arm, snapping it off by his shoulder, which caused him to let out a huge wail at the pain. "Don't mess with my family again!"4

Victoria had managed to get a small jump on Edward, which caused Riley to look over in a panic, the vampire took notice and kicked the Hunter into a tree, who landed with a thud.+

Seth went to help Riley, leaving the vampire to jump over to where Edward was punching down on Victoria, and he pushed Edward off, starting to fight with him.+

"No!" Riley shouted, using her new abilities to run over to the pair and tackle the male Riley, who growled down as he landed on top of her, she fought against him as he reached down and grabbed her hand, snapping it in return to what happens with his arm, and she let out a huge scream at the antagonising pain.6

Edward was caught in a head lock as Riley was left on the floor on pain, Bella held the blade her sister gave to her and met Edward's eyes, slicing it down sharply so the bliss dropped down her arm and distracted the vampires.+

Edward took over the situation quickly and pushed away the pair of them, the boy being caught on Riley's arms who had jumped up at the blood, she held onto his waist and sent him over into a tree as karma, Seth sending a low growl as he approached him. +

Seth gripped the vampire's shoulder in his hold, who called out to his so called 'love', but the girl ignored him and he was dragged away by the wolf, soon behind followed by Riley.+

"Rip him to shreds" Riley reminded Seth, who was biting down harshly, snapping the boys arm off as he kept screaming. "Hold him still"2

Seth did as told and Riley stepped in front of the simpering vampire, she sent a small and pitiful look towards him.+

"You shouldn't have fallen for her, especially now because you messed with my family, at least I'll be more forgiving than the others" She spoke down to the cowering vampire, before she gripped is head in her good hand and snapped it clean off, thankful to Athena's spell and she watched the head fall to the ground, the body falling limb. "We need to see if the others are okay"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Jake!" Riley shouted as she reached the battle grounds, letting out a breathe from her fast speed before she kneeled down beside her friend who's ribs had just been crushed. "Oh God"+

Carlisle turned him on his side, Edward helping him. "Jacob, don't worry. Carlisle is going to take care of you"+

"Half of his body is shattered" Carlisle states as he observed the hurt teenager, before he glanced up at Bella who lands down in the grass as well.+

"Riley" Jake says wearily as he spots who's stroking his hair gently, and the girl sends him a small smile as the pack comes running out dressed.+

"Jake! You idiot! I had him!" Leah shoots down at the hurt wolf, and Riley sends her a sharp look.+

"Leah" Sam warns as he sits beside Jake as well, noting down the fact that Riley's hand was also hurt.+

"We need to reset the bones, with his accelerating healing, it's already starting" Carlisle describes as he holds Jake's arm, and Riley looks over to her cousin who is watching in Emmett's arms.+

"We need to get him out of here, we're not gonna want to fight with the volturri" Edward states, tension high as the royal vampires were on their way.+

"I can reset the bones" Riley suddenly states attention flipping to her. "I have the strength and Athena can use some charms to help ease the pain"2

Athena nods in agreement, walking away from Emmett as her thoughts were completely on helping Jake, and staying away from royal vampires who didn't know her kind existed.+

"We'll take him back to Billy's" Sam says.+

"Hang in there Jake" Bella simply says before she stands up so that the pack can help Jake back home.3

"I'll take care of him" Riley promised her older sister as Jake grunts, being picked up by the pack. "You look after yourself as well"+

"Always" Bella nods, watching Jake being carried away.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Okay, set him down on the bed" Riley instructs as they reach the house, Billy settling back in the living room as he worries for his son, the pack take him to the room and rest him down as gently as possible, the boy writhing in pain. "I need cold water, a cloth, a towel and Athena, start helping with the pain"+

The pack snaps into action as Paul hangs back, seeing his imprint helping out Jake. "Is your hand okay?"+

"I'll fix it after" She snaps at Paul quickly, thanking Sam when he brings her the things she needs. "I need the room clear"+

Sam pushes the boys back into the living room as the girls stay inside, Riley sends Jake the best smile she could muster. +

"This is going to be very painful, but it will be better afterwards" Riley promised him, dipping the cloth into the bowl of cold water before she folds it and rests it on his head. "Okay, Athena you need to start"+

Athena nods sharply as she placed her hands on the sides of Jake's head, beginning to mutter something in a language order than Viking's, and Jake seems to take to the spells well.+

"Okay..." Riley trails off, feeling along his broken bone, before she holds her breathe and snaps the first one towards its correct place, giving him a few seconds before she snaps it again, leading it back to its original place. "I'm sorry Jake! Just a few more, I promise!"+

Jake let's out another scream as she cracks another, the whole pack wincing as hey hear it on the other side of the door, and Riley sends him soothing words as she continues on. "Riley, I need—I need her"1

"I'll get her as soon as we're done" Riley nods, brushing his hair as she snaps another one, a tear going down her cheek as she sees her friend in such pain.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Athena was the first one out of the room, claiming that she had done everything she could possibly do, before she excused herself to call 'someone'. The pack didn't bother listening in as they didn't know that Athena was ringing up Jacob's imprint.+

Who knew everything.+

"Is he okay?" The blonde asked as Athena let her inside, and the pack all sent her confused looks as Athena tried to calm her down. "Athena, tell me that Jake is okay"+

"Riley is with him" Athena sighs, gesturing for the grin to take a seat on the sofa, beside Paul, who was waiting for his imprint to finish.+

There was a loud scream of pain which caused the stranger to flinch, before they heard a small yet soothing shushing sound, which was Riley trying to help calm him down.1

There wasn't any sound after that, and they all turned their attention to the door as it opened, but Riley didn't look at any of them as she met the blonde girls eyes, letting out a sigh of relief. "Jess"22

"Riles" The stranger responded, jumping up and hugging the girl who looked tired. +

"He's been asking for you" Riley let out in a tried voiced pulling away from the hug, the taller girl nodded before she marched towards the room confidently, the others still not knowing who she was.+

"Who was that?" Jared broke the ice.+

"His imprint" Riley responded in a tone of exhaustion, collapsing down on the couch next to Paul, who placed his arm around her tiredly. "He's healing now, just needs to be on bed rest until he's fully recovered"+

"Never again" Riley sighed as she sunk into Emily's arms, the woman greeting them all as they came over from Jacob's (Riley had kicked them all out to leave Jake with Jess, so they could rest up without prying eyes).2

"I agree" Emily smiled gently into the hug she was receiving from Riley, not even giving her fiancé a hug yet. "Why is your hand wrapped up?"1

"She killed this guy named Riley, who was also a vampire...he hurt her hand and she totally kicked his ass" Seth explained excitedly, gaining a smack on the back of his head when he swore. "Ow!"+

Riley pulled away from Emily with a grin on her face, "He totally deserved it after hurting my family"1

"Can I get a hug now?" Sam questioned from the side, waiting to give his imprint some love and affection after a hard day, Emily just let out a playful laugh before she pulled him into a hug, letting him pamper her face with kisses.1

"I'm going to see Kim" Jared says, looking up from his phone, showing that he had been ignoring them all and messaging her. "She wants to see me"+

"Tell her I said hi" Riley smiles, and the guy nods before he runs out of the house in a haste, wanting to get to his girlfriend as quickly as possible, Riley then hugged Quil and Embry goodbye as they said they were too tried to stay any longer (and that their mothers were worrying).+

"I'm taking Seth home" Leah states tensely at the room, Riley giving her and Seth a quick hug goodbye, thanking Seth for looking after her today and keeping her alive. "Riles, don't go loosing your virginity to Paul, I couldn't handle it"19

Riley blushed as Paul let out a laugh, probably assuming that legs was joking, but Riley knew that she wasn't.+

Leah never joked about relationships.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"So, I was thinking that we should cuddle up in our pyjamas and sleep for a while day" Riley explained her plans she had with Paul as they entered his house, peeling her coat away as Paul shut and locked the front door.+

"How about we shower and then get into our pyjamas?" Paul offers, licking his thumb before rubbing a bit of dirt that was stuck on Riley's cheek, before he gently caressed her face. "You can go first as I set up some snacks"+

Riley smiles up at him softly, before she reaches forward and pecks his cheek. "Thanks, I don't know what I'd do without you"+

"Probably be sat with another wolf watching films, you know they'd all be willing to for you" Paul joked, and Riley sent him a small smile, watching his hand fall away from her face and into her waist. +

"Maybe I'll go to one of them instead" She grins cheekily, only for Paul to send her a playful gaze, before he kissed her nose.+

"Nice try, go shower" Paul instructs, and she lets out a small pout as he tries to push her away. "Ri, put the pout away and go shower"+

Riley smiles at him before she sounds around and walks towards the bathroom, knowing she already had a towel laying around for her anyway, since he had over six towels for no reason. 3

She closes the bathroom door and lets out a small sigh, silently questioning how she got so lucky as she walks in front of the mirror and spots the state of herself, battle didn't suit her.+

Thankfully, she'd have her cupcake pyjama bottoms and Paul's high school football jacket awaiting in one of Paul's drawers, where she had placed some of her things last night.+

Riley quickly showered off any reminders of the battle, scrubbing her body and hair with small bottles that she had brought from her house, before she jumped back away from the warmth and wrapped a purple towel around her body.+

She unlocked the bathroom and padded her way over to Paul's bedroom, shivering in the cold as it hit her towel-covered body.+

When she reached the room, Paul had her clothes laid out for her (minus her underwear) and even had his own laid besides hers so he could change after his shower as well.+

"Hi" She makes herself known, and he looks up to her quickly, making sure to only meet her eyes do he's not being disrespectful. 17

"Hey" Paul responds, before he presses a kiss to her head. "I'm going to shower now, the living room is ready for us"+

"Okay, thank you" Riley grins at him, and he presses another kiss to her cheek before he walks out of the room, shutting it behind him so she can have her privacy.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

There was nothing that Riley had hated more in life than over thinking, it was the reason why she had unintentionally caused herself a panic attack in middle school, having to do a speech in front of her English class had caused her too much stress as she hated the attention, judgment and staring eyes on her.1

She had hidden away inside the girls bathroom until she had sent her older sister a message to say where she was when she hadn't appeared at the front so they could walk home together, Riley had felt too ashamed to go back to classes.+

It was the same reason that she couldn't go to her freshmen year spring dance, as she had overthought the fact of having to get dressed up and dancing in a big crowd of people she didn't know.+

And now she couldn't help but squirm every so often as she sat beside Paul on the sofa, something that he had yet to pick up on, or so she thought anyway.+

"What's wrong?" He asked finally, pausing the movie as his attention turned fully to their girl beside him, he reached forward to grins hair away from her face and caress her cheek, causing a reaction to settle deep within Riley.+

"What are we?" Riley asked, Paul's face being so close to hers that she could barely breathe. "I know I said slow...and we have been...it's just, we kissed the other day"+

"I know" Paul grinned as he remembered their encounter, he had wanted to do it again ever since, not wanting to let her go in the first case. "What do you want to be? We're going at your pace"+

"Our pace" Riley corrected, her eyes scanning over Paul's as his face seemingly grew closed, and she let her eyes flutter shut as her breathe hitched and she savoured the moment slightly. "W-we could move on to the...lovers"4

"I'd love to" Paul responded, his smile not weakening as he watched his imprint's expressions closely, it seemed that she wanted it as much as he did and that made him more happy than anyone else could even imagine.+

"Paul" Riley's voice lowered slightly as her eyes opened up again to challenge his, and he noticed her eyes were more dilated than usual, and he licked his lips subconsciously.+

"Yes Ri?" He asked, watched her carefully, his hand squeezing her waist more tightly as he awaited her to finish.+

"I need you to kiss me" She finally stated, and Paul practically pounced onto her lips as her heard those words, the phrase 'gladly' coming to his mind as his free hand rises up to caress her cheek, tugging her towards his body.6

Riley raised her body so that she was around the equal height of him, her hands curling up into his hair, after having discovered that he liked his hair being played with from the last time they had kissed, he specifically told her afterwards that he lied the way she tugged his hair—which had her blushing like a mad man.8

He gently began to lean her downwards, wanting her to relax after the hard day that they had both had, he was extremely cautious about the sprained hand that was currently laying with his hair, her legs had naturally left and opening for his body to lay down in, which had him smirking into the kiss as she was adapting quickly to the kissed, returning it with as much passion as he was.3

"We should stop" Paul suddenly said, pulled away and resting his hands on both sides of her head. "I don't want this to be your first time, you deserve better"12

Riley blushed, but nodded in agreement as she lay underneath the boy, her hand resting on his neck. "Okay"3

"Now, let's get comfy and finish Mary Poppins" Paul smiles sweetly, pressing a kiss to her lips before he sat back and pulled her up with him, the pair shifting so they were in a comfortable cuddling position, Paul pulling a blanket around them as Riley grabbed the bowl of chocolate, offering him one when he had pressed play on the movie. "Yes, please"9


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Wolves can be so dense sometimes..."+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Riley, promise me you'll take care of each other!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Sit down and let the women discuss this"+

In which she chooses between her worlds+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"A wedding?" Riley stuttered on her words as she sat with Bella in the flowery meadow that Edward had proposed to Bella in a few months prior, Riley was left with her mouth slightly open as she took it in, Bella getting married? To Edward? Only being 18? "What did dad say?"+

"He said it was okay, if I was sure I wanted this and that if I loved him" Bella stated, nodding her head slowly as she remembered his words, and Riley smiled at her sister gently. "But, I want to know what you think about it, because you're my sister and my best friend-wether you like it or not"+

Riley let out a giggle at her sisters words, the world seeming so much brighter than a few weeks ago when they were fighting against new born vampires, it was happy place where they were all starting up their new lives. Riley had been working in the hospital, often seen in the children's wards, comforting and reading to them as she watched over them in the break room. +

Bella and Edward were closer than ever, apparently secretly planning a wedding behind Riley's back, alongside the wolves. The sad thing was that she probably wasn't allowed to tell anyone yet, as Bella marrying Edward would mean the ultimate decision would happen-Bella would fake her death and move away for Charlie's lifetime, only being able to see Riley in small visits or phone calls.+

It sounded horrible, but Riley knew that it was what Bella wanted more than anything, so she wasn't going to stand in her way.+

"So, do we have your blessing?" Bella asked carefully, noticing that her sister had day dreamed off onto the bushes in the corner of the meadow, and Riley spun to her with a grin.+

"Are you kidding! I'm actually going to officially have the Cullen's in my family!" She let out in a squeal, before she jumped forwards to hug her older sister, who returned the hug happily.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Okay, never thought I'd be one to say it, but....I'm jealous of Riley's calligraphy skills" Athena grumbled as she was sat at the Cullen's table with the girls, who were currently making up some invitations to the wedding (being sectioned off for those who knew the guests best, which left Riley with the wolves). "I would frame that if I was sent an invitation"+

"Just practice for her own wedding" Esme offered a playful smile as she looked over at the youngest girl, who tried to hide her blush as she focused on her writing.+

"She'll probably have even better handwriting by then" Athena complained, she was currently writing some to her side of the family that knew Bella (or were related), she hated the idea of inviting her parents as she knew that they either wouldn't come, or they'd judge the whole time and spread rumours.+

"I hope so, this is starting to loom sloppy" Riley sighed as she looked down at the one she was writing to the Clearwater's, seeing as they were a close family and part of the elders (Sue). Athena scoffed at her cousin, throwing an envelope at her over the table.+

"Guys!" Alice warned as she placed down her pen in distaste to what they were doing. "We have to finish these tonight! Otherwise they'll get it later...which would be less officiant"+

"Careful Bella, you've got yourself a wedding planning-zilla" Athena smirked, only for Alice to seat at her arm, which caused her to let out a yelp. "Alright! I'm working!"+

Riley let out a laugh at her family before she slipped the bow dry paper into the envelope and sealed it shut, writing on the 'Clearwater's' on the front before she but it to the side, signifying where the letter would end up. Alice had made up five different piles, the Rez, forks, Cullen's family and friends, Bella's family and other.+

"Riley, stop staring and move on to the next one" Alice snapped at the younger girl, and Riley sent her a small smile as she grabbed the next card, noticing who this one was going to be made for.+

This was going to break Jake's heart...4


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

The news was painful for Riley to deliver, she had to take the letters around the Rez seeing as the Cullen's weren't allowed over and none of them liked the idea of the wolves flipping out on Bella.+

Which left Riley, with weapons Jasper had supplied her with just in case the scenario got to that point. She had a spell on her from Athena, giving her the supernatural abilities again so she could be more aware of everything and could run if necessary.+

"Thank you for the invitation, will you tell Bella that we would love to be there?" Sue asked with a gentle smile on her lips, Seth nodding in agreement beside her, being glad that he could go somewhere other than La Push, Leah had stormed off upstairs when she realised what it was.2

"Of course" Riley smiled back, giving Sue a quick hug before she moved on to her next place, which wasn't exactly a wedding invitation, but was in fact a letter from Carlisle to Sam-speaking of what would happen to Bella after she was married, they would probably have to leave if they were to turn her.+

She hummed along to an old rhyme she remembered, trying to get the tension to leave her body as she heard laughter from inside of Emily's house, showing that there was other people inside, she would probably look like a traitor.+

Riley took a deep breathe before she walked up the porch and knocked on the door, waiting for somebody to answer it for her, and she hated herself even more when Emily opened it up.+

"Riley! I told you, you don't need to knock" Emily said sweetly, before she noticed the look on Riley's face. "What's wrong?"+

There was a loud clatter of noise as if someone had dropped everything, and Riley's confusion was answered when Paul appeared behind Emily, smiling over the woman's head as he caught sight of his girlfriend.2

"I-I'm here for Sam" Riley spoke nervously, fighting with the letter in her hands, that was sealed with the Cullen's crest with wax on the back and everything.+

"Okay, come in" Emily says in an encouraging voice, letting Riley step inside, who doesn't speak or look at either of them as she keeps her eyes on the floor. "Riley is here for you Sam"+

Sam turns his head from the sofa in confusion, before he realises there's a letter in her hand and the conflicted look on her face that told them all that she didn't want to be there. "Riley?"+

She took a deep breath before she held the letter towards him, letting him grab it from her and observer the crest sealed on the back. "Carlisle asked me to deliver it to you"+

Sam glanced at Emily and Paul uneasily before he ripped it open, going over the words, mumbling a few of them slightly before he clenched his eyes from anger, soon opening time and looking up at Riley with a sad expression. "Did you have no say in this?"+

"It's what she wants" Riley answers, and he nods, taking it as her answer.+

"I'll need to speak to the elder's, have you told Jake?" Sam questions, and Riley shakes her head sadly before she pulls her final one out of her pocket with a sad look.+

"He's my final stop, I'm going to talk with him through it" Riley admits, and Sam nods once again. "I'll be leaving then.."+

Riley leaves the place sharply, wanting to get out of the tense building, and wanting to reach Jake before anything could beat her to it or take over their lives again.+

"What just happened?" Paul quizzed, wondering why his imprint hadn't dared to meet his eyes, before he and Emily looked at the letter with curiosity. "What is that?"+

"Bella Swan is marrying the Cullen boy, and she wants to become a vampire after it"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            3

"Jake" Riley breathed out when he had answers the door, the rain had poured down on her, leaving her drenched from the typical Fork's and La Push weather.+

Jake stood in front of Riley with a confused expression on his face, he hadn't exactly been expecting her to show up on his doorstep looking like a drenched puppy, but he didn't like the face that she had on either. Something was wrong. "Riles?"+

She didn't say anything else, just held out the letter to him sadly, which he took cautiously before he took it over to where his dad was sat in the living room. Riley hug back by the door, waiting for his reaction to kick in so she could try and be there for him.+

She watched his jaw clenched and unclench as he read it quickly, his brain wrapping around it and coming to concept with what had happened.+

He stood up sharply, not even thinking straight as he headed straight towards the door, not bothering to answer his dads confused calling, dropping the invitation on his porch before he ripped his shirt off, ready to shift.+

"Jake!" Riley cut into his line of bailable, and his steps faltered as he met her eyes, he held a finger up accusingly.+

"You didn't stop her!" He countered angrily, and she shook her head at him as the rain caused her hair to stick to her face, she was upset as to how her friend was reacting, and she didn't know how to help this time. "You were supposed to stop her! You were supposed to make sure she would be happy!"+

"She will be happy Jake!" Riley shouted back, surprising them both as she had raised her voice at him, but she shook her head at him as if saying her was wrong. "She will always be happy with Edward, neither can live without the other and if she truly wants to leave us all—leave us—leave you...or even me! Then so be it!"+

"Being dead won't make her happy" Jake responded, his eyes glowering down on Riley. "You're being selfish"+

He pushed her shoulder as he tried to walk away again, only for her to hold onto his shoulder with her newfound strength and turn him around again. "You're being selfish! You're happy, so why can't she be?!"+

"Because she'll be leaving us all behind Riley! When we all die, she will regret her choice! She won't know the people in the graves, because she wouldn't have even been here" Jake shouted down at her, and his words hit Riley hard as she began to falter in her anger, her facade coming down as tears began to fall from her eyes.+

"You just have to be selfless enough to let her go Jake" Riley's voice came down, "if you walk away, you'll be the one abandoning everyone—how is the pack and your dad going to feel about that?! How is Jess going to feel?!"+

"Don't bring her into this" Jake growled at her animal-like, but Riley shook her head again, angrily wiping away any stray tears.+

"You started it! You're the one running away and being a coward! She may be your best friend, but you are not the only person she will be leaving!" Riley's anger had peaked again, and Jake was shaking uncontrollably. "So, take that and shove it somewhere special!"4

"Get out of my way Riley" Jake warned her, and Riley pushed his shoulders as he tried to walk forward again, accidentally pushing him away further than she had anticipated.+

She pushed him too far and he had lost any sense of control that he had left in him, immediately regretting what he did afterwards as his wolf cried down at her body on the floor, where she was crying from the pain, clutching onto her stomach as the rain mixed with the wound.6

Jake noticed the packs thoughts reaching toward them, and so he ran off with the only chance he got, leaving Riley alone and hurt in the rain—knowing the pack would be there to help soon.17


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Oh God, it's huge" Alice gasped once she caught sight of the wound that was healing on Riley's side, Riley smiled weakly at the girl who stood in her doorway, she was finally home after three days of being stood in the horrible hospital that she usually liked.3

In her own home, the wolves were actually allowed to visit her, as it was equal territory at current times. +

Alice had offered to come over and help her bathe and get dressed as Riley hadn't been able to move much without the chance of pulling the stitches that were currently sporting her under a massive bandage.+

"Thanks for doing this Alice" Riley thanked the girl, who helped the girl towards the bathroom, knowing that's she needed to brush her teeth and wash her face for the day before she actually changed her clothes, thankfully Alice was a vampire so it made moving around easier.+

"Of course! I wouldn't leave any of my sisters to deal with this on their own" Alice smiled at the girl, before she reached onto the shelves and pulled out the toothpaste and toothbrush from Riley, so the girl wouldn't have to reach up for them. "I'll go get a fresh towel to clean your face with"+

Alice walked out graciously, leaving Riley to look into her reflection, she did indeed look like a mess. While others were wondering if she was scared of Jake or if she didn't want to go near another wolf again, or even that she was ashamed of the scars that would appear there on her side.+

She was, in fact, scared for wherever Jake was. She new he'd be beating himself up about everything he said to Riley, alongside with the scratches that he had embedded into her body by accident, but he wouldn't take any of her calls, the ones where she was finally left alone for a few minutes so she tried to ring her best friend to comfort him.+

Carlisle had almost took her phone away from her when he caught her on it one evening, but when he had asked what she was doing, he let her continue as he knew she was worried about the wolf.+

They weren't naturally supposed to be alone.+

"Here we go! I got yellow, assuming it's yours" Alice chirped as she entered the room. "Now, do you want to bathe now or later? After everyone had visited"+

Riley opted for before as she knew when everyone left she would need a huge nap.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley hated tense atmosphere, having Emily and Paul with her wasn't good at all, she couldn't tell what was going on in Paul's head as he looked conflicted between comforting her and killing her. Emily was smothering her with things she had brought over, claiming that a few of them helped when she had been hurt.+

"Emily" Riley smiled up at the woman, who gunned in return as she organised the medicine on Riley's dresser. "We'll be scar buddies"2

Emily sent her a heartfelt expression, before she wrapped her arms around the girl gently, giving her warmth that she had needed in days—no offence to her vampire family. "This better not become a habit out of any of us, I think we've all been through enough"+

"Had anyone heard from Jake?" Riley finally asked as Emily pulled back and held onto her hand, and her heart fell when Emily shook her head. +

"Why? He's the one who put you here" Paul spoke up for the first time since he had been around, and Riley sighed as she realised that Paul was angry with Jake fro hurting her.+

"Emily? Could you give us a moment please?" Riley asked gently, and Emily quickly agreed, kissing Riley's head quickly before she left the room rather hastily to leave them to it—closing the door behind her as she went. "Come here Paul"+

Paul looked unsure, but eventually moved over so he sat beside Riley, but his eyes seems to stick to the bandage that was peaking out of her tank top she was currently wearing. Riley let out a small smile at his expression, before she raised her hand to hold one of his cheeks.+

"It was an accident and I will never hid it against Jake, nor anyone for that matter. He didn't have any control...and I'm sure anyone would've lost it in his place, I was just as angry with him" Riley explained to Paul, forcing his eyes to meet hers, and she had a grin greet her lips when he finally gave up the battle and maintained eye contact.+

"You have green bits in your eyes" Paul states, changing the subject without even meaning too, he had gotten lost in her eyes—his body less tense as before, there wasn't a trace of anger as he came right back to his centre, Riley.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"If Alice says one more thing about her vision of Bella's wedding, I'm going to snap" Athena grumbled as she was moving nature around in the garden, she was bending it to her will so that she didn't have to do any heavy lifting with the body, Riley had been forced to do table settings and the ceremony flowers, which would be around a lot to stick to the 'image' that Alice has of the place.+

Emmett had asked where to place a giant log when Alice had screamed out about nobody having a vision again, making Jasper catch Athena's arm as the grin went to attack Alice for the second time that day.2

"Alright, I'll calm down" Athena promised, turning back to the alter, where she made vines and flowers stretch around it to make it more 'woodland inspired' or whatever Alice had said.+

"So, did you invite Alisha?" Riley started the conversation with Jasper, who sent her a playful look in return.+

"Did you ask Paul?"+

"Touché Jasper" Riley laughed along, before she realised that she did invite Paul, because Jasper had insisted that she brought her boyfriend for them all to warn about hurting her. "You asked Alisha out?!"+

"Shh" Jasper placed his hand over her mouth as she squealed, and he glanced around before nodding to himself as he noticed nobody was paying attention, so he dropped his hand from her mouth. "Yes, but it's only a friend thing"+

"Friend thing" Riley rolled her eyes as she repeated the phrase, he sounded like very classic guy before they fell in love with the girl, Alisha and Jasper were made for each other—Ancestors had already made sure of that.+

What more proof did they both need.+

"Are you ready for the big day then?" Jasper moved the conversation over to the actual wedding day. "Big responsibility being Bella's maid of Honour and having to be the first one to walk down the isle, in heels that Alice is no doubt going to force you in to"+

"Jas, why must you remind me of my suffering?" Riley questioned rhetorically, tying some flowers onto the end of a row of chairs, and the she admired her work from a step back. "I only just got my stitches out and she's making me dress up in heels and a dress, I have no idea who this will end up worse for"+

"You" Jasper answered without a single doubt, setting out another chair, not even bothering to double check as he knew that Alice would probably come out later and change it all.+

"I hate when you're right" Riley complained, whining slightly as she picked up another bunch of flowers that she had formed into a nice looking bouquet, which she had slaves away many hours for a few days prior.+

She had no patience when it came to cutting all the flowers to the perfect length, alongside all the ribbon and etc....she vowed to herself that her wedding was going to be more simple, even if it meant that she'd have to lock away Alice until an hour before the wedding—only giving her time to change and get her make up done.+

"What did you plan for Bella's bachelorette anyway? Because the guys are all taking Edward out" Jasper asked curiously, knowing that Bella hated anything like that.+

"It's sister time, unfortunately for everyone else" Riley smiled slightly, "when we were seven and five, we vowed that whoever got married first had to build a fort for the other one, seeing as we were both lazy and didn't know how to do it at the time. Then, we'd stay up and eat all our favourite food while we talk about our favourite times. Obviously we only thought of our play time when we were kids, but now we're going to use it to talk about our life together"+

Jasper couldn't say anything after that, he knew escrow how she felt, seeing as he had to figure out a place to move so he could still manage to see his mate, although, he couldn't imagine loosing a sibling. So, he sent her a smile, which she returned before they heard Alice shouting again—causing them both to snap into working mode.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

(I tried to match her dress to the wedding :/ )9

Riley sighed as she sat by the window, her hair and make up already been done by Alice, the weather seems nice but she couldn't help but feel like something was off—as though something would happen to them again.+

Bella was currently being hidden away behind layers of concealer, see in hand she hadn't gotten enough sleep last night, or that was her excuse after all.+

The bachelorette had been extremely successful, Riley had even got Bella to cry at a certain memory that they went though together, at some point their dad had joined them as they searched through a couple of photo albums that Riley had hidden away in her room.+

Riley had been wondering where the heck Paul was for the last hour now, he was never one tone late when it came to her, and it caused her panic as she didn't think that she could walk down the isle without knowing he was near.+

"Alisha called" Jasper started as he entered the room with a splint expression, before he took the seat beside her. "Sam isn't letting them cross over because of the covens that will be here, he doesn't think that they would keep their calm"+

Riley nodded in understanding, she knew where Sam was aiming at, after all, Paul had tried to kill her sister accidentally when they had first met—which seemed forever ago now that she thought about it. "I'll be fine Jasper, we just have to pray even harder that I won't trip on my way down the isle"+

Jasper laughed at that, before he wrapped his arm around her shoulder, the pair beginning to engage in a chat to help pass the time.2


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Her make up and hair was checked once more over as she stood behind the door to walk down toward the isle, Bella and her father were walking behind her, her father offering that they could still do a runner if necessary, which had caused Riley's smile to spread even further.+

'Hearts best fast, colors and promises...'4

Riley sends Bella a quick reassuring smile, taking her place beside where she would be walking down once she was signalled, Charlie looped his arm with his daughter, physically ready to carry his daughter away (he was never going to be mentally ready).+

'How to be brave, how can I love? When I'm..afraid to...fall...'+

Riley was given her signal and she made herself be known at the top of the isle, smiling when she noticed Edward already awaiting at the alter that they had all slaved away to make, she could now see how it was all worth it.+

For Bella and Edward.+

'But watching you stand...alone. All of my doubts, suddenly goes away somehow..."+

Riley walks down with a bouquet of white flowers in her hands, smiling at anyone who she happens to catch sight of, and she happily reaches the end and stands up tall, where everyone awaits Bella to walk down next.+

'One...step...closer....'+

Bella and Charlie revealed themselves around the corner, her holding onto his arm as he held his posture nice and tall in his tuxedo, Riley sighed at Bella looking so beautiful in her dress—damming, Alice was good at planning weddings.+

'I have died everyday, waiting for you. Darling don't be afraid, I have love you for a thousand years...I'll love you for a thousand more....'1

Bella had reached the end where she was passed on to Edward, they both seemed less tense as they were finally together again, and Riley smiled happily for her sister as he wiped away a stray tear from her cheek, she was so happy for her sister.1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"If one more of those vampires even glance at me, I'm going to rip their heads off" Athena complains with a glass of wine in her hands, her eyes glaring at the vampires who dared to look at her, they found Athena strange and unnatural since they had never heard of her kind before.+

"No blood or wars during my sisters wedding" Riley warned, sending Athena a short look that had the girl huffing. "Hand me the glass and go find Emmett, he can cheer you up"+

"He'll just annoy me even more" Athena sang out slowly, before she let out a sigh and handed her the glass, before she walked away to find her beloved.+

"Riley, come with me" Jasper suddenly appeared behind Riley, grabbing her elbow gently as he spun her around face him, scaring the living daylights out of her in the process. "There's someone you'll want to see"+

"Who?" Riley asked, but it wasn't answered as she was dragged away to behind the house, which she found sketchy by she didn't question it, just allowed him to tug her along. "Jake?!"+

She spotted her sister dancing with Jake, but they pulled away from each other as they turned to the new arrival, and Jake's eyes turned sad as he glanced at her stomach sadly.+

"Jake, oh my God! We were so worried!" Riley showed no sigh of anger or resentment and instead ran full force into his arms, hugging him closely as he slowly returned the favour, glad that she still wanted to be his friends. "Why did you leave! You scared us!"+

Jake let out a laugh as she pulled back from him, before he grabbed her shoulders. "I thought you hated me, I didn't want to come back to that, I couldn't handle my best friend hating me"+

"Embry and Quil are going to be so jealous that you said that"2


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Are you sure you want to do this?" Alisha asked again as they stood on top of the cliff, Riley looking down uneasily as some rocks slipped off easily as she moved her feet towards the edge. 2

Riley had declared that she had to go cliff diving at one point in her life, and she'd rather do it before she's crushed by the fact that her sisters dead and won't be able to see her for years.+

Besides, it would get her mind off of everything.+

Riley nodded strongly as she turns her head back to Leah and Alisha, "I'm sure"+

"Alright..." Leah trailed off unsure, before she peeled off the shorts and top that she had brought, leaving her behind in a black swimsuit. "Come on then"+

Alisha rolled her eyes before following the girls actions, she had a lilac bikini on, and she sent Riley an encouraging smile.+

Riley took a deep breath before she took of her shirt and leggings, placing a hand on her side instinctively as she didn't like people looking at her scar that she had, especially not Paul as he always seemed to treat her like a China doll.1

"Alright, I'll go first" Alisha smirked, spinning around and walking backwards towards the edge of the cliff before she dived backwards, Leah scoffing as the girl decided to show off with a backwards dive.+

When they heard the splash, Leah glanced at Riley, silently asking if she wanted or go next. "Why did I think about this? Athena is going to kill me"+

"Paul is going to kill us all" Leah responded with a snort, before she held a hand out to her friend. "We can go down together"+

Riley placed her hand in Leah's. trusting her completely as she moved her hand from her waist and sent the girl a nod, Leah smiled at Riley's movements.+

"On three..." Leah prepared the girl, signalling that they were going to run and jump together. "Okay? One..."+

"Two..." Riley breathed out, her voice shaking slightly from the cold, thank God Leah had her shifter heat.+

"One!" Leah shouted, and the pair ran together as fast as they could, jumping off the hill with a squeal and a small scream. 1

They fell down hastily, hitting the water loudly as they never let go of each other's hands, Leah's head bobbed up from the water and Alisha swam over to them before they both helped Riley stable herself properly.+

After Riley had her breathing back to normal, she wore a massive grin, "that was fun"1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

After they had swam back to the beach, the girls collected their clothes quickly before they walked back to the pack house...Emily's house, deciding that they change back into their clothes after they had showered and dried off.+

"Hi!" Riley greeted brightly as she entered, forgetting all the worried about her scar on her stomach.+

"You guys went without me!" Kim gasped as she noticed they were wearing their swimwear, she was perched on Jared's lap as usual, both of them clinging to each other.+

"We did call you" Alisha responded with her arms crossed over, before she noticed the look on Paul's face. "I think I'm going to shower first..."+

She quickly walked out of the room and towards the shower, not bothering to let the human go first, but Leah had her arm around Riley's shoulders ever concern she first shivered.+

"Come here" Paul finally sighed, opening his arm to the girl, Riley smiled before she hastily ran forward and into Paul's arms. Her arms wrapped around his stomach as his wrapped around her shoulders and he sent a gentle kiss to her head before smiling down at her. "Did you at least have fun before you froze?"+

"Yeah, it was amazing" Riley grinned, her words muffled slightly by being against Paul—who was actually wearing a shirt for once in his shifter life.+

"Riley is showering next" Paul says as he looks over Riley to look at Leah, who rolls her eyes, not even phased by the dampness that dropped from her hair. "She's cold and she's wet and she's also in a bikini in the middle of the pack house"2

"Here, she can have a towel" Emily offered as she appeared out of nowhere, Riley jolted in surprise and Paul just took it greatfully before wrapping it around Riley's body so she was covered, and then he took her back into his arms.+

"Didn't know you were a bikini girl, Riley" Jared smirked, only to be smacked on the back of his head by Kim. "Ow!"2

"Oops, I didn't mean to hit that hard, sorry J" Kim pouted as she held his head in her hands, kissing where she hit, Jared just sent a proud smile out to anyone who saw it—those two were sickly sometimes.1


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

It had started off like any normal day for Riley...well, as normal as her life could get when she was constantly surrounded by the supernatural. She had spent the night at Paul's again, who was great to cuddle with because he was so warm and soft (when explained to the pack, Jared almost died of laughter while Paul was actually embarrassed).2

She has arrived back at her home to spend some time with her dad, she had cooked him some dinner and even watched the game with him, even if she had no clue what was going on.+

And then, just as she sighed and fell backwards on to her bed around ten in the evening, she strangely got a phone call.+

Riley's eyebrows furrowed at it began to buzz, and then she picked it up and realised who it was, answering it immediately. "Bells? What's going on? I thought Edward said he wouldn't make you go to a party or anything busy"+

"Riles" Bella stated her name, and a feeling hit Riley as though they were still connected in some way, she knew that Bella was in trouble.+

"Bella? Tell me what's wrong" Riley spoke calmly, listening to Bella carefully on the other end, who seemed to be checking for the area was clear before she spoke down the phone.+

"I think Edward somehow got me pregnant" Bella whispered, and Riley's eyes widened at the sentence as she nearly dropped her phone.+

"He did what?!" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley slammed the car door shut before she ran straight ahead towards the giant glass house, when Bella left for the honeymoon she told Riley that's he should have the truck from now on, which made Riley cry.4

She was breathing heavily as she used her spare key and unlocked the door hastily, opening and shutting it as soon as possible as she ran forward and scanned the room for her target, and surprisingly, it wasn't Bella.+

"You" She spoke on such rage that none of them had ever heard from her, she gripped his T-shirt which was strangely wrinkled from his lack of care. "How could you do this to her and then treat her like vermin?! Do you have any idea what you've done?!"+

Jasper sent her a wave of calmness before he grabbed her waist and rugged her backwards, spinning her around to see him. "We can't do anything, it's Bella's choice"2

"Bella" Riley breathed out, before she had tried to look for her sister again, only for Edward to point towards the living room, Riley only shoved past him and entered the room with an unrecognisable look, and she gasped when she saw Rosalie helping Bella eat something. "Bells?"+

"Riley, you came" Bella smiled as she noticed her younger sister, and Riley's eyes widened as she saw how swollen Bella's stomach looked. "Before you say anything, I want to have the baby"+

"...Okay" Riley nodded in agreement, if it was something Bella wanted then she couldn't exactly argue against it. Besides, how could she set back and watch as people try and kill her niece or nephew. "It's your choice Bella"+

Riley then took the seat next to Bella, sending a smile to Rosalie who returned it. Riley knew that what Rosalie wanted more than anything, was a family of her own, a niece or nephew was the best she was going to get.+

"I was so not prepared to be an aunt" Riley broke into the tension, from where Edward was watching as he was leaning against the doorway. Rosalie and Bella let out soft laughs at the girl, she seemed to brighten the mood. "I hope it's a girl, I can't wait to make a scrap book about them. Not forgetting about how they'll need a wardrobe, I will fight Alice to get the baby to at least wear some form of rainbow"+

Bella laughed beside her sister, listening to all the palms she wanted to have with her niece (or so she assumed). She rested her head on Riley's shoulder quietly and decided to rest her eyes for a few moments, feeling Rosalie place a blanket over her as Riley went silent.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Trying to keep the wolves at bay was extremely hard, they had no idea where Riley was all the time and it was beginning to annoy them. Riley could tell. The main person Bella always wanted was her sister, as she was really emotional and cold, Riley was the perfect person as everyone else was....well dead, no offence to them.+

Edward had shut Bella and the baby out, carrying a hatred for the worlds as he had complete given up on it all, he acted as though Bella was already dead, her sickly figure just a ghost wandering around the house.+

Athena had found out a few days later that Bella was pregnant, and immediately began to put works together with Carlisle to come up with things to help the baby and Bella, she decided to support Bella as she noticed the amount of people against it. Even Alice...+

The baby was slowly sucking away Bella's life and she looked as though she was fading, it was a horrible sight but Bella kept on fighting so she could keep her baby.+

That, Riley admired more than anything in the world.+

But, they had to figure out what was wrong with Bella and why the baby was taking out the life, Athena was loosing her patience slowly and time was running thin.+

The worst fact of all is that Jake had found out, which lead Riley to wait patiently with Bella, knowing that Jake might go and tell the pack.It made her anxious as Paul was never going to forgive her for this, not that it was the most important thing on her mind. But, she never expected to be put in a position where she knew she'd have to pick her family over him.1

"Bella, no matter what, they won't touch you or the baby" Athena states firmly, Bella feeling a pain on her side from the baby as Athena holds her hand over it, trying to calm the baby down.+

"You have our full support and they won't touch you" Riley nodded surly, knowing that Jasper had a spare kit of some fighting gear in his room. "I won't let them, any of them"+

"Anyways, I thought of something we could do for the baby" Athena says randomly, her hands dripping down from Bella's side as the baby stops. "We should be able to communicate"+

"Communicate?" Riley repeats, "a link? Like when I was linked to Bella?"+

"And I'll need to use you again" Athena admits sheepishly, "I won't be able to use a vampire as they aren't the living...plus, you're a blood relative so it's an easier connection."+

"I'll do it" Riley agrees, Rosalie squeezing her shoulder as a small thanks after she answers, and Riley smiles up at her in return before she turns back to Athena. "I'll do anything for my family" And this had never been clearer to any of them.+

There was a noise from outside the house that caused everyone to move into action, some staying inside as they others went to go check on it, watching as the wind outside began to blow in a twisted way and figured slowly crawled out of the darkness that was once seen as their beautiful surrounding, Athena had forced Riley behind her instantly. +

"Jake?" Riley asked first, spotting some of her friends, before three other figures came out alongside him. "Leah? Alisha? Seth? What is going on?"+

"We left" Jake started, and Riley gulped as she realised what had happened, before she smiled at the few who were there.+

"Thank you for being here" And she meant it, this was going to get harder and they needed any hands they could get.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Sam has lost the element of surprise and he doesn't want to take you on outnumbered, so he's not going to take you on head-on. He's got the place surrounded and he'll wait for his opportunity" Jake informs as everyone as they sat/stood around together.+

"They won't get through without a fight" Emmett stated firmly as he has his arms wrapped around Athena, trying to comfort her silently as her woke body was tense, she hadn't relaxed in days.+

"No fights, we won't be the one who breaks the treaty" Carlisle says, turning his head back to Jake.+

"The treaty is void, at least in Sam's mind" Jake concludes, and Riley holds on to his hand tighter, being the one who was sat down next to him. +

"Not in ours" Esme responds.+

"Carlisle, no ones hunted for weeks" Emmett states, stepping forward as he glanced at Edward, who meets his eyes momentarily.+

"We'll make do" Esme resorts quickly, turning around to her adoptive son and it goes silent for a moment as everyone was unsure of what to do.+

"We can arrange something later" Athena concluded as she steps forwards and pulls Emmett back again, trying to sooth him this time.+

"You've done us a great service Jacob, thank you" Carlisle says to Jake, who nods in return, wishing he could do more.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Does he know that I knew?" Riley finally asks as they stand under the stars, staring out int to the forests abyss, wolves watching over them for the right moment of weakness, Leah looking around on guard, Riley had come with some weapons just in case.+

"Yes, he feels betrayed" Leah responded sharply, before she notices the hurt look on Riley's face. "It doesn't matter though, because after this, we're going to win and prove them all wrong"+

"We always do" Riley smiles, the first Leah had seen since she came back. "So, they're really watching us right now?"+

"Yeah" Leah answers honestly, her eyes watching the trees around them again. "I heard that your going to go under some stupid spell and talk to the baby"+

"I'll be the first one to speak to the baby" Riley grins, "I'm just happy that Bella gets the chance, she always wanted a family when we were growing up and she was willing to throw it away if it meant she could be with Edward"+

"Would you want one?" Leah asks, keeping the conversation going.+

"I don't think I will at this point" Riley jokes, "Paul won't look at me, and I won't leave my family"+

"I can't even imagine the place you're in" Leah admits, tilting her short-haired head towards the girl beside her. "How you must be feeling with all this" +

"It's not me I'm worried about" Riley spoke back softly as she turned to the trees, Leah seemed confused slightly by her action and turned to face the deep woods. "The moment of weakness they're after....it's when my sister dies and we will have to do anything in that moment to keep my niece or nephew safe, no matter who the enemy is" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Athena rubs wet powder onto the sides of Riley's head, slowly chanting something under her breathe as she does, Riley sat with her legs crossed as she was facing opposite Bella and the growing baby bump.+

"Thank you" Bella mouths to Riley, who goes to smile but cringes as a high pitched sound comes to her head, and she begins to jolt around slightly as she starts to let out whimpers, fighting against Rosalie's hold so she could get out.+

It was a natural instinct that she was fighting, all she knew was that it hurt like hell and she couldn't even think in that moment.+

After a few minutes of Riley screaming out in pain, she stopped suddenly and Rosalie slowly removed her hands from the frozen girl.+

"Now we just have to wait" Athena states as she still holds on to Riley's head, "she'll get her answers and then she'll come back"+

It was a tense few moments where everyone in the room was watching her closely, even Edward who was trying to peak inside the baby's mind again, to no Advil. Carlisle was stood somewhere in the background waiting to know what his grandchild needed, everyone else was either guarding or hiding in a room.+

And then, she gasped as her eyes shot open, and Athena dropped her hands and leaned towards the girl instantly, grabbing her cousins hands and soothing her. +

"Jake was right" Riley breathed out, her gasps slot down as her chest was heaving slightly. "The baby needs blood, it's why she isn't handling it well, it's taking her blood to live"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"No" Riley concluded in disgust as she watched Carlisle being out a blood bag, Jasper had already left the room with betrayed look when he found out Carlisle had some blood in the house this shown time, which had Athena laughing despite the whole tense surrounding, she wouldn't stop laughing until Emmett pulled her to his chest so that her laughs were muffled.1

They soon left the room along with the others, not wanting to be around the blood.+

She turned to Jake, who's nose crinkled up. "Wait, wait, wait. You're going to make her drink that?"+

"Only if you're comfortable with it" Edward says, his eyes turning to Bella as he actually spoke to her for once and not out of anger.+

"I'll try anything" Bella responded, watching as Carlisle walked over with the cup full of blood, instantly making Riley's stomach feel queasy, and she worked at a hospital.+

"I think I'm going to be sick" Jake says as he begins to remove himself from the room, sending Riley a small look to ask her if she wanted to go with him.+

She glanced at Bella unsure, but when Bella gave her a smile, she gifted one back before she grabbed Jake's hand that he offered to her and the pair began to leave the room as quickly as possible.+

"Thanks Jake, I don't think I would've kept my dinner in" Riley mumbled as they reached outside, Leah and Seth in sight as Alisha was off somewhere near the back, Jake gave Leah a nod, who gave one back before she ran off to go help in the back. "Alpha suits you"+

"I know" Jake adds on with a cheeky grin, and she shoves his arm playfully. "I'm not afraid to push back"+

"Try me, alpha" Riley mocks, and Jake finally pushes her arm, ultimately sending her to the ground by his strength. "Jacob! I am so calling Jess to come sort out her boyfriend"+

"No, don't. She told me not annoy anyone if I was to stay here" Jake sends a warning look to Riley, who laughs when she hears that Jake is afraid of the wrath of his own imprint.+

"You're scared of Jess?!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

The plan was easy, the wolves would go distract the pack, the majority of the Cullen's would go out and feed as the others stayed back and took care of Bella and the baby.+

Bella had picked out two names that Riley thought were amazing, much to Edward's demise. Reneesme and E.J. She was so happy that Bella's features were turning more normal and that the baby was doing well.4

But when Bella went to have some more blood, the drink dropped to the floor and Bella insisted that she grabbed the drink, leaning over on her own.+

Her spine broke backwards and everyone had an immediate reaction to help her, Edward catching her head as she fell to the floor, everyone else had crashed on the floor beside her to help.+

"Rosalie, pass the morphine" Edward states sharply after he had laid Bella into Carlisle's bed he had laid out for the birth, and Rosalie handed the needle over to Edward quickly, who injected it into Bella.+

"Carlisle said the placenta must've detached" Alice speaks as she had Carlisle on the other end of the phone, and Riley cringed as she knew they had to get the baby out and try and turn Bella as soon as possible, or else they'd both die. "He's coming as fast as he can"+

"Then we'll have to do it" Rosalie states, and Riley nods in agreement as she pushed Bella's hair away from her face, trying to sooth the girl as much as she could. Rosalie picked up a knife to get her already, Edward quickly grabbed her wrist.+

"Let the morphine spread" Edward responded, and Rosalie's jaw clenched slightly as Athena began to waver her hands over Bella, trying to help them both the best she could do.+

"There's no time, he's dying" Rosalie states firmly, glancing at Edward.+

"I can help with the pain" Athena adds in, sending a look to Edward. "We need to help them, now"+

"Get him out, now!" Bella screams deeply as she struggled, and Riley almost cried at the moment. +

Rosalie sticks the knife in as Riley directs Bella's attention away from it, knowing the wolves could hear everything outside. "Listen to me Bella, you're both going to be fine, okay? We're going to make sure you're both fine"+

Bella screams in agony as everyone looks away from the scene, apart from Rosalie who focuses and Riley who whispers comforting words to try and help.1

Rosalie holds up the knife as blood is on it, and Edward instantly recognised her face. "Rosalie, don't!" +

He tackles her for the knife as Riley takes over, having seen people do it on the hospital, Athena sends her cousins an encouraging look as Riley try's to get the baby out, Bella screaming in pain as she fights against Jake, who had moved towards her when Riley moved.2

"Alice, her her out of here!" Edward instructs Alice, who drags Rosalie away as Bella screams out her name.+

"Change her, you have to change her"+

"I can't, not while he's still in there" Edward responds, walking over to help Riley, who seemed to actually be handling it well.+

Athena's hands were shaking like mad as she had her eyes clenched shut, peeling away all she had to help save her family, she was loosing a lot of blood quickly and there was only so much Athena could do to comfort a dying person.+

"Stay focused, keep your heart beating" Jake keeps his eyes on Bella, as Bella trashes around and screams.+

"He's suffocating!!" +

Edward leans over and bites down to get the baby out quickly, Riley helping guide him properly as Bella flashes in and out of consciousness, Blood had spread anywhere but Riley kept her mind on the baby.+

There was a moment of silence as Edward held up the bloody baby, chuckling lightly as he looked down, it was a moment of joy. Riley let out a breath as a smile appeared on her face at the sight.+

"It's a girl" Riley grinned as the baby began to let out a cry, Edward cradling it to his chest as Riley watched with tearful eyes. "Bella, she's got your eyes"+

"It's Renesmee." Edward announces to everyone in a soothing voice, looking over at Bella, his eyes full of love as Bella let's out a sigh.+

"Beautiful" Bella's broken and tiny voice speaks, Athena calming down with her spells as her eyes were watching the baby girl.+

Edward handed over the baby to Bella carefully, who held the baby to her as though her life depended on it, everyone was smiling at the sight, even Athena.+

The baby begins to cry again and Edward walks forward to take the baby away, the next few moments were chaos as Rosalie randomly appeared around the corner and Athena began shouting her spells as Bella was slipping.1

"Bella, Bells. Hold on for me" Riley cured out from beside her sister, Edward rushing back after handing Renesmee off to Rosalie, who left the room to take care of the baby. "You hear me Bella?"+

"Riley, promise you'll take care of each other" Bella says weakly, her eyes shutting as Edward was pumping his hands against her chest to get her breathing again.+

"Always!" Riley responds in a shout, before Bella closed her eyes. "Bella?! Bella!!!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"The wolves" Athena states as she enters the room where Riley is holding on to Renesmee gently, the baby seems to be calm mainly around her, her eyes sleeping away peacefully.+

"I'm coming, stay here" Rosalie instructs Riley, before she goes to run off, only for Riley to grab her wrist and stop her.+

"You take Renesmee, I know the wolves, they can't hurt me" Riley says, handing Renesmee over to Rosalie, the baby opening her eyes slowly in confusion, but Riley just smiles before pressing a kiss to her head. "Let's go Athena"1

They rush outside to see Edward, Alice and Jasper already stood there. Wolves growls on the other side, Athena let's out a glare as she catches sight of them, Riley just sliding a blade out of nowhere, and they march forward to make the group bigger.+

The wolves come charging forward as Athena sends a nod to Edward, and the side fighting for Bella and Renesmee run forwards as well to meet their anger, the bodies clashing together as they fought.+

"I'm sorry about this Embry" Riley says, before she grabs his legs and slams him against a tree, the wolf growling as he lands on all fours again, he was conflicted what to do in that moment of time. She was still an imprint. "If you're too afraid to fight me, this is going to be very one sided"+

She charges forward again and launches herself onto his back, pulling him to the ground as he attempts to spin around and bite her, he manages to get the upper hand and nip a part of her hand, causing her to scream before Leah appeared and pushed him away.1

Riley stood up slowly as she winced at her hand, Leah giving her an unsure glance before she ran forwards to help the others, Riley soon following. "Get off him!"+

Riley pushed her own boyfriend off of Jasper, who stands up in front of her to go and help Edward, but someone else beat them to the chase. "You made it" The others had joined from their hunt and reunited as a bigger family.+

"About time" Athena adds on moodily, her leg hurt as Quil had hit her, before she had sent him into a boulder of course.+

Everyone is back in action again, Alisha finally appearing from where she had previously been behind the house, joining in immediately as she didn't hold back her anger.+

"I don't want to fight you" Riley says carefully as Paul faces her with his teeth bared out. "And I lied, but I did it to my family...and I'm sorry it got this far, but I wont let you kill my baby niece"+

And with that, she send her boyfriend into a tree as she kicks him away after he attempted to jump on her, her heart aching as she heard Paul's whimper, but she reminded herself that they were in opposite sides.+

Riley let's out a scream as she's pushed onto the ground again, someone dragging her by the ankle with their teeth, she was in for a few doctor appointments after this. She tried to kick them off with the other foot, only for it not to help.+

"Riley!" Athena shouted her name, her eyes filled with rage as she saw the wolf dragging her cousin, she had a newfound anger as she lifted her hand up with a fire. "Get. Off her!!"+

She launched the ball forward, the wolf jumping over to the side as they dodged it, and they went to get Athena as vines travelled up them and held it down in its place, Athena smiling wickedly as she had it pinned down, but it was wiped off as it broke off the vines and began to walk towards her like prey. +

Emmett grabbed Riley and placed her behind him as the family were surrounded by the wolves, Athena's hands lit on fire as she was prepared to kill anyone who stepped near them, Emmett keeping Riley behind his arm as he stranded his ground between Athena and Jasper.+

"Stop!" Seth's voice suddenly cut in, jumping over Riley as he landed in front of them. "It's over!"5

Sam growled and went to bite Seth, only for Seth to jump back in surprise.+

"If you kill her you kill me!" Seth shouted, a new side of him revealing itself as everyone took the words in, Riley smiled at Seth, walking forward to stand next to him, her eyes meeting Sam's wolfish ones, but Sam quickly growled and ran towards Seth, Riley screaming as she was pushed back and caught by Esme.12

Seth transformed as he began to growl back at Sam, Edward realising what had just happened. "Seth imprinted. They can't hurt her, whoever a wolf imprints on, can't be harmed. It's their most absolute law"29


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Everything seemed to mellow back to normality apart from Renesmee, who was growing abnormally fast, Riley had offered a few conclusions to Carlisle, who had written them down just in case he ran out of things to think about, he had written down her growth in a book he was going to write about them.+

Riley had taken so many photos that she already had one scrapbook full, she was even taking them with her when she visited Emily today, since the woman had cursed Sam for doing that. Apparently, Emily had walked out and stayed with Sue until she heard the baby was okay.1

"Riley" Emily smiled as the girl approached the house, she had ran out to the porch the second she heard a car pull up. She leaped forward to hug the girl eagerly, who returned it sheepishly.+

"I thought you were going to hate me" Riley admitted in a low voice as she was crushed in Emily's arms, and Emily let out a melodic laugh as she pulled back.+

"I understand why you lied, I'm just mad that you didn't come sooner" Emily playfully stated, feeling eyes watching from the house. "How's the new bites?"+

Riley smiled sadly as she held up her hand that had been wrapped up, before her jeans up slightly so Emily could see the bandaged ankle. "I have scars all over me"+

Emily nodded as she remembered how insecure she felt when she first got them, and now Riley and three of them. The girl most likely wouldn't want to be in a bikini for a while.6

"I've thrown out all my cropped top and shorts jeans, Alice is going to buy me clothes that hide them more" Riley admits as she holds on to her bag with fine hand, before she reasoned what she brought. "I brought you a scrapbook I made of Renesme, you'll love it"+

"Let's head inside" Emily nodded towards the house, where people ducked away from the window quickly when Riley looked over.+

"Sure" Riley agreed, letting Emily grab her god hand before they walked towards the house slowly. "So, how much did Sam beg you to feed him again?"+

"Hours" Emily answered with a chuckle, and she opened the door, the pair entering into silence. "I didn't budge, though"+

Riley felt like she had intruded immediately, especially after seeing some of the other imprints there, she went to turn around only for Emily to hold her shoulders gently. "I'm going to go..."+

"No, you're going to stay here, show me baby pictures and tell me how your sister is doing" Emily instructed, closing the door with one hand before she guided Riley over to the sofa, where none of the guys were sat. "Now, photos"+

Riley nodded silently as she brought the book out of her bag and opened it up for Emily to view, the woman gasped as she took the book away from her. "She's so cute! You were right....why is she growing that quickly?"+

Riley noticed the concern in Emily's tone, "Carlisle has no idea"+

"And you do?" Emily questioned, and Riley blushed slightly.+

"I read legend of a man who was claimed to grow unnaturally, he was raised by another family member as his mother died strangely at birth, they believed him to be a witch" Riley opens up, telling the same story she had told Seth. "He went missing after he had mysteriously stopped growing unnaturally, I believe I could try and find him"+

"Find him? Why would you want to find him?" Emily asked the question that the wolves wanted to ask as they watched the two girls chatting from the kitchen table, Jared slowly raising food to his mouth as he watched.2

"They aren't human and they're not vampires, they're what some call hybrids or half-bloods or whatever you want to call them, I suppose. If he is alive, he can tell us what ages he stopped growing and what he can do and so much more" Riley finished off, before she smiled down at the photo of Renesmee in her own arms, Rosalie had insisted that Riley had a picture too. "I want to make sure she's safe"1

Emily smiled sadly, "and your sister?"+

Riley took in a breathe, "her heart hasn't stopped, but she's certainly  not coming out of this as a human. Edward has been worried to death."+

The air was awkward again and Riley mentally cursed herself, she wanted to try and mend the relationships she has with them all, not make them more strained. Her phone randomly chimes and she picks it up, standing up as she reads the message over.+

"I have to go, Seth says he needs me there" Riley says softly, typing in a reply before she puts her phone back in her bag, Emily stands up and hands her the scrapbook. "Sorry I couldn't stay long"+

"Not a worry, in fact, I actually made some food for Renesmee. You said she was able to eat human food?" Emily asks, walking off and into the kitchen, leaving Riley glancing anywhere but at the wolves awkwardly, her phone chimes again and she pulls it out with an eye roll, seeing it's a phone call this time.+

"Hello?" She asks.+

"Did they say anything? Do I need to kick some werewolves ass?" Alisha ask on the other end, and Riley blushed when she noticed that the wolves can hear. "Shut up Jasper, I'm checking up on my friend....I know she's your friend but—"3

Riley ends the call quickly and throws it back in her bag, just as Emily appears with a bright smile and a tub full of food. "You're an angel, Emily"+

"Call me if you need anything" Emily demands as Riley begins to walk towards the door. "Anything, I mean it"+

"Will do, Em" Riley laughs, closing the door as she finally leaves the house, Emily's smile dropping as she spins around and slaps Paul's head.3

"You idiot! You should speak to her!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Seth, you don't need to watch me change her" Riley warns as she holds Renesmee in her arms, Seth fighting to be in the room with her as she just wanted to change the baby's clothes.+

"Why?!" He whines out, his eyes on Rensemee the whole time. +

"If you don't, I'm going to get Athena to take you outside" Riley threatens, and Seth finally gives up as he settles against the wall, folding his arms moodily as Riley walks in to the baby's room with a smile of victory. "I was thinking....your dungarees with a rainbow shirt"+

Rensemee just held her hand against Riley's cheek, showing her all the memories they had together once again, it seemed to be the only way she could communicate currently. But it brought a smile on Riley's face in response.+

"Alright, sit still on the side while I get the clothes" Riley smiles, placing the baby on the changing table before she leans down and pulls the drawers out, picking out the clothes before rakish back up and smiling at Renesmee. "Let's get you changed"+

As she starts to change the baby, her phone begins to ring randomly, and she answers it, placing it between her ears and ear as she mutters a hello.+

"Hi Riley, what are you up to?" Emily chimes on the other side, and Riley lifted Rensemee's arms so she could put them into the shirt.+

"Just changing Renesmee into her clothes for the day, cutest outfit I've ever seen" Riley coos the ending, tickling Renesmee's foot, making her squeal out a giggle that had Riley's heart aching.+

"Adorable" Emily comments as she hears it on the other end, she had Sam and Paul listening in, even though they didn't know they she knew they were listening. "How about we go shopping or something today?"+

"I can't" Riley cringed sadly as she declined, pulling the dungarees up her niece. "If I leave Seth alone with Renesmee one more time, I think he might actually kidnap her"+

"What?" Emily laughed in confusion, and Riley glanced at the door.+

"I had to force him out of the room just so I could change her clothes, and I don't exactly have the hunters spell on me anymore, it was a difficult task" Riley admits, "even harder than taking care of a baby"+

"Well, imprinting is like that" Emily let out naturally, making a hurt expression appear on Riley's face, Renesmee realising as she lifted her hand to touch her aunts cheek, and Riley let out a small gasp. "What? What wrong?"+

"Nothing, Renesmee is just communicating with me through her abilities" Riley was smiling down at her niece, slipping the last of the straps on before she fully picked her niece up in her arms. "And can we not bring up imprinting? Paul hates me right now and I'd rather not have a reminder, it's bad enough that everywhere I look in this house, a couple is in love"+

".....you think Paul hates you?" Emily asked after a while, her eyes on Paul who was watching the phone with sad eyes.+

"Yes" Riley let out in a mumbling tone, before the door was opened wide by Seth, who eagerly smiled at Renemee and reached out for her, Riley gave her over with a huff. "I swear to God Seth, I'm going to kill you if you are impatient like that again"+

"I can't help it!" Seth defended, his face smiling down at Renesmee, who was staring at his button on his shirt, she liked napping with Seth as he was so warm and cuddly, plus he always had soft clothes on when she napped on him.+

"Seth broke in?" Emily guessed with humour, cursing in to what Paul thought was 'flirting'. Sam just thought he was acting jealous because of the bond and it's current strain.+

"Yes" Riley mumbled back down the phone, sending a glare to the boy who paid no attention to her.+

"Don't you have to the to lunch with that guy?" Seth quizzed, his hands holding Renesmee gently.6

"What guy?" Paul asked on the other side of the phone, Riley not hearing him as she didn't have supernatural hearing.1

"I'm going now Seth" Riley responded, before she began speaking to Emily again. "Em, I have to go. I'll call you later, okay?"+

"Sure! See you soon!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"That was horrible" Riley cringed as she arrived at Emily's house, her body tipping slightly from her clumsiness. "Damn it, I thought I didn't inherit that trait"+

"Where were you?" A deep voice asks, and Riley turns her head to see Paul, sat at the table with dark look on his face as his arms were crossed over.+

"Where's Emily and Sam?" Riley quizzed, scared that she might be left alone with someone who currently hated her, Paul's expression stayed dark and confusing, she had no idea what he was thinking.+

"Away, where were you?" He asks again, Riley's stomach launching butterflies as she hears his deep tone, she shifted on her feet as she glanced around for any sign of someone who could save her from the currently over-bearing...ex? boyfriend? She didn't know. "Where were you, Riley?"+

"Alright!" Riley breathed out, fiddling with her fingers. "I was having lunch with the Head of the Children's department in the hospital, he wanted to offer me a full-time job that he didn't want to do over the phone" +

"Really?" Paul questioned, his features softening as he realised she was right. "Right, er, sorry"+

"Would it really bother you if I went out on a date with someone else, I mean, it's not like you are speaking to me anyway" Riley mumbled, knowing he could hear her, and he let out a deep sigh before stepping towards her, the pull feeling stronger than ever.+

"Can I see them?" Paul asked, and Riley's eyebrows furrowed in confusion, he nodded his head as he took another step closer, resting the waters. "Your scars"+

Riley blushed as she subconsciously covered her stomach with her scarred hand, not wanting to show them to him, but he smiled down at her softly and took another step closer, being closer than ever to her. +

"Please?" He tried in a pleading tone, and Riley let out a cross between a sigh and a huff, before she let out a small nod. Paul didn't want to see the reminder of what he blindly supported, but he needed to see them with his own eyes to somewhat settle himself, that she's still okay.+

He firstly gripped her hand in his softly, lifting it up so he could see the scar up close, it wasn't as worse as he had imagined it but it still pained him to see her hurt like this, he almost killed the whole pack when he found out Riley had gotten hurt, it was their utmost law.+

And yet, Riley apparently stuck up for the wolves to Emily, saying she yelled at them to do it.+

He pressed a gentle kiss to her palm, along the scar, causing goosebumps to spread through Riley slowly, creeping up on her as a blush tinted her cheeks. He was being quite intimate considering how rude he usually was to everyone.+

Then, he reached down to her top with his other hand, glancing up at her for permission to lift it up, she let out a nod as she was in a slight daze from the sudden attention. 3

With her permission, he lifted the top up gently and finally got a view of her large scar, the one Jake had done when he was upset, he looked at a loss as he kneeled beside her, before he pressed another kiss to it, kissing along it as Riley's toes seemed to curl in her trainers. 4

She hadn't experienced what she was now, and she didn't know how to control herself. Riley gripped his shoulders and pulled him up towards her, sliding her hands up his neck and to his cheeks, giving him a toothy smile before she pressed her lips towards his.+

Paul's hands instantly wrapped around her waist, loving her random dominance over the kiss, she seemed to be out of her shy shell for once and he was loving it.+

Her hands soon tangled onto his hair, his lips moving away from hers when she had to gasp for her breathe, and he trailed small kisses down her neck, making her shift her head to the side to allow him more access, and she let out a moan.2

Riley pushed him off her and pressed her hand to her mouth, "oh my God"+

"I'm sorry Riley, I'm so sorry. I-I didn't mean to go that far" Paul tried to apologise, not attempting to reach out to her, but she shook her head quickly at him.+

"No, no" Riley shook her head, before she met his eyes again, something new in her eyes that Paul hadn't seen before. "I, erm, I moaned...."+

Paul let out a grin, "yeah, you did"+

"Can you, erm" Riley paused, reaching forward and holding his hands, glancing down before meeting his eyes again. "Do that again?"+

Paul gulped as he looked down at her, "let's go to my house"14


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley had spent the entire night catching up with Paul, speaking lowly as she was curled up in his arms, not wishing to let go of the moment as she had missed him too much, he hadn't talked as much as she did as his eyes just couldn't keep away from her features as she spoke, his lips in a smile that wouldn't wipe away.+

She had eventually fallen asleep on him, which led him to carrying her into his room and surrounding her in blankets as she lay on his bed, he joined beside her, making sure to keep his distance.+

But, when Riley had woken up to her phone ringing, she found her body clinging onto his like a koala, her arm around his chest as her legs were tangled on his hips and legs, she ultimately blushed.+

His arms were wrapped around her shoulders, his chin resting on her head as she glanced over at the phone, trying to come up with the best way to pry herself off him and grab the phone.+

She slid her legs off slowly, Paul gripping her body closer when she did, and she scoffed through her flushed state, out of annoyance and embarrassment. The phone began to ring again, the buzzing echo digging through the wooden table beside the bed, and she let out a huff as she tried to take his hands off, but it took her a few minutes and a lot of strength to get him off.+

She tumbled off the bed when she had gotten his hands off, her body falling into the floor with a loud thump, causing Paul to wake up abruptly and go to reach for her, and he panicked slowly as he realised Riley wasn't beside him, before his body relaxed as he caught sight of her on the floor. +

"Riley?" He asked in confusion, although the sleep in his voice was enough for Riley to begin blushing again, before the phone rang again and she snatched it off the table as she was sat on the floor beside it, she answered it quickly.+

"Riley! Finally!" Rosalie breathed out on the other end. "It's Bella's time, we need you to look after Renesmee as we get everything prepared"+

"Of course" Riley smiled on the other end, glancing up at Paul who had stood up fully and held his hand out to her, hauling her up quickly when she grabbed his hand instantly. "When do you want me there?"+

"As soon as possible, don't be afraid to bring one of the mu—pack members, they are technically family now" She huffed on the other end, before she heard something else. "Jasper and that wolf girl have been really close"+

"Oh yeah, they're official now" Riley casually said, before her eyes widened at what she had revealed. "Which you shouldn't know yet—don't tell anyone"+

"Like it isn't obvious already" Rosalie said low-key, before her attention turned to something else. "Alright, be here soon, I'll see you when you get here"+

"Bye Rosa" Riley smiled before the call was ended and she looked up from her phone to meet her boyfriends eyes. "Are you ready to meet my niece? We're on babysitting duty"+

"You mean Seth's imprint?" Paul asked with confusion, he really didn't understand the whole 'innocent Seth imprinted on a baby' thing, Riley had tried to explain it to him, but she wasn't successful.+

"Yeah, he'll probably already be there" Riley states quickly, before she wanders over to Paul's dressed, pulling out the top drawer so she could pick out an outfit to wear (since she had a few things there). "He probably won't like you being near her, he barely lets Leah, almost bit her head off the first time Leah met her"+

Paul crept up behind her and wraps his hands around her waist, sending a kiss to her bare shoulder. "I'm not interested in anyone else, if anything, I'm kind of like her uncle"+

Riley's eyes shone slightly at the phrase, but she didn't say anything, just hummed as he sent another kiss to her shoulder. "Don't distract me, we need to go look after our niece"+

"Fine" Paul let go of her; sending a final kiss to her head as he pulled out a few clothes as well, before he gave her a wink and walked towards the bathroom, leaving Riley behind with a confused yet embarrassed expression.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"There's my pretty girl!" Riley grinned as she walked forward in the living room, snatching up her niece into her arms as Renesmee let out a squeal of excitement, which was big considering she never really let out any sounds, Renesmee placed her hand on Riley's cheeks as a greeting, who smiled as she was able to see all their memories together. "Hi Renesmee" +

Riley held her niece closely in her arms, she had grown bigger again but Riley didn't let it phase her as she sound the girl around until she stopped at the giggle that erupted. She turned to Paul, smiling brightly as she noticed how happy he looked there, dispite the house being full of vampires.+

"Renesmee, this is Paul" Riley began, Rosalie and Seth tensing in the corner as they watched Riley's walk towards Paul, the wolf with a big temper. "Come closer Paul, you're not going to hurt her, I promise"+

Paul relaxed at her words and watched the baby closely, he couldn't deny it, the baby was adorable. "Hi Renesmee"3

"Why don't you try and hold her?" Riley offered, Seth going to walk over, only to be held back by Rosalie, who told him a silent look to stay there until they were needed. "Just ease you hands around her and support her body properly, she's able to hold her own head up so don't worry too much about that"+

Paul took the baby carefully, be extremely gentle as he didn't want to harm it in anyway, and when he had the baby settled against his side, he let out a smile. "I did it"+

"You did" Riley smiled proudly, before she silently lifted her camera from the nearby book shelf and snapped a quick shot, looking down at it. "This is going in the scrap book"+

Renesmee placed her hands on Paul's cheeks, silently communicating with him as Paul's face seems to be confused, Renesmee played over the memory of him holding her for the first time, and Paul got to see Riley's excitement all over again.+

"She's very unique, isn't she?" Riley asked, watching as Renesmee pulled her hands away from his cheeks and tucked her head onto his shoulder, resting against him silently as he held her. +

"Yeah" Paul breathed out, glancing over at Rosalie and Seth, who had both calmed down. "Can someone take her now? I don't want to risk anything, baby steps and all that"+

Seth stepped forward instantly and grabbed the girl into his arms, his whole body untensing as he placed his forehead against hers and let her placed her hands on his cheeks, Riley walked over to Paul wordlessly.+

"Wow, he is clingy" Paul let out, watching Seth land on the sofa carefully, placing Renesmee on his knees as he began to talk to her slowly. Paul let his hand slip into her own silently and Riley shot him a challenging look.+

"He's clingy?" Riley repeated, knowing full well that Paul had clung onto her earlier as she only wanted to brush her teeth. "Okay then, how about the time when—" +

Paul pulled her against his chest, her words muffled against his chest as she attempted to speak, and she began to let out huffs as she tried to tug his arms off, which soon fell to her waist and began to tickle her, her laughter filling the once silent house as she thrashed around from his touch.+

"I'm leaving to help the others" Rosalie states with a grin look on her face, walking out of the room as her sister-in-law was breathing for her life as a smile didn't drop from her face.+

"Alright! I won't say anything!" Riley gasped out, Paul stopping as she submitted herself to him, and he let a grin fall to his face as she turned to face him, he lifted his hand up and brushed her hair behind her shoulders.+

"If you're going to make out, please do it where we're not" Seth let out, and Paul halted at him as Riley spun around unfazed.+

"Give me my niece Seth, I will fight you for her"+

"She's awake" was a phrase that Riley was awoken with from her nap, it was a phrase that filled her with so much delight and excitement. She practically bounced out of the chair she was in before she took ahold of her niece again, who had also woken up from nap with Seth.+

Bella was awake.+

"Oh, I think it's time for a snack before we meeting your mom" Riley smiled down at her niece, who just relaxed in her aunts arms as she rested her head on her chest, making Riley's heart melt. +

She began to walk outside of Renesmee's room, heading towards the main stairs where she walked down slowly to see almost all of the family sat/stood around together, she just smiled at them before walking over to the kitchen, Seth following her.+

"I can hold her while you cook" Seth offered politely, and Riley flashed him a short smiled as she got out a tray of some bacon, planning to chop it up into tiny bits for Renesmee to eat. +

"I'm okay Seth, she's rather comfy where she is" Riley waves him off, placing a pan down on the stove before she sprayed it and laid down a piece of bacon, not knowing how much Renesmee would want to eat as she had just woken up, Riley patted her nieces back as she walked over to the cupboards, pulling out a cup so that she could get the girl a drink. She finally sighed. "Fine, you can hold her while she drinks"+

Seth grinned happy before he took his imprint into his arms quickly, noticing how she had grew a little bigger again. He grabbed the cup that Riley offered to him before he handed it over to Renesmee, who took ahold of it weakly and began to drink from it, Seth helping support the bottle.+

Riley flipped over the bacon and smiled at the pair, before she realised that the wolves might need feeding as well. "Seth, how about you go sit with the others? I'm going to make a snack for the wolves"+

Seth smiled at her before he set off out the room, probably going to tell Jake about the food since he had taken position as an alpha as well. +

Riley quickly began to take out some ingredients, and grinned once she saw Esme arriving in the room gracefully. "I heard you're cooking for the wolves, I thought I would come and help"+

"Thank you, Esme" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Okay, hand me my niece before I chop your hands off" Riley snapped at the wolf who was stood opposite her, holding onto Renesmee on the other side of the dinning room table, they both ran around and swapped sides again, making Riley angry. "Seth! Bella won't want to arrive to a wolf holding her baby!"+

Seth whimpered slightly at that and Riley let out a deep breath to calm herself, her fists unclenching as she focused on Seth again, only to see her niece placing her hands on Seth's cheeks as he smiled. She was cheering him up.+

"Okay, I'll hold her here Bella arrives and you can hold her after" Riley bargained, "you can even stand next to me the whole time"+

Seth finally agreed and handed over his imprint to Riley, who took her with a smile before she rubbed their noses together playfully, erupting laughter out of Renesmee.+

"They're back" Jake randomly popped up in the doorway, and he and Seth exchanged silent looks before Jake nodded and headed back into the room.+

"We won't leave your side" Riley comforted, before she took Seth's hand with her free one and guided him into the main area where everyone was awaiting, and Riley smiled gently at everyone when they flickered their attention to Riley and the baby. "Hi guys"+

Bella suddenly appeared in the front door with Edward stood by her side, she was clad in a new blue dress that Alice had obviously bought for her. Riley hated to admit it, but her sister got in perfectly with the vampires, her beauty only seemed to improve as she became such a being and it didn't look as though she had given birth at all.+

She looked beautiful.+

"Riley" Bella breathed out when she caught sight of her sister and baby, she went to step forward only for a couple people to tensely get in the way quickly.+

"Maybe it's best we try on someone else first" Athena offered from beside Emmett, and he cringed when he realised what she was suggesting. Athena shoved his arms away and marched forward to her cousin, wrapping her up in a hug quickly. "Wow, you're not as cold as I thought you'd be"+

Bella let out a melodic laugh into the hug before her cousin had pulled back from her, nodding once she realised she was in control. Bella then cautiously looked towards her daughter and sister. "How long was I out?"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"You watched her while I was....turning?" Bella asked as she watched her sister interact with her daughter, Renesmee seemed to love Riley's attention more than anybody else's, it almost saddened Bella how her daughter preferred her sister, but she knew that Riley was there for her when she couldn't be.+

"Of course, I made a promise and I intended to keep it" Riley shoes gently to her sister, helping Renesmee with her almost-walking, holding her hands as they walked around near the trees. Renesmee loved the outside world and Riley knew they were most likely going to end up having trouble with that.+

Seth couldn't be there that day as Sam and Jake had asked him to be on patrol today, the two packs had decided to combine and it actually worked better having two Alphas as it made it easier to keep an eye out on anything and it didn't put too much pressure on anyone in particular.+

"How's it going with Paul?" Bella peered slightly, interested in how her sisters life was going, she was tired of talking about herself and she wanted to spend every moment she could with her sister, as Riley only had so much time.+

"Great" Riley grinned happily, "dad likes him, a lot better than Edward—sorry about that. But, I feel like we're in a good place right now and we're finally getting to know each other better because we don't have any obstacles in the way" +

"And...when do you think your next step will be?" Bella asked curiously, watching as Renesmee was clinging on to Riley's shirt, babbling on about nothing at all as she sat up on her own already. "Or...what the next step would be?"+

"Well, we've had dates and everything so I'm not exactly sure"Riley spoke softly, before she leaned closer to her niece and cooed at the girl, pressing a kiss to Renesmee's cheek as she pulled away. +

"According to Jake, watching you interact with a baby has been very...eye opening for Paul" Bella worded in carefully, and she saw her sisters look of confusion. "He means that you interacting with Renesmee is making him think about your future together"5

"Oh" Riley breathed out with a flushed face, and she looked back down at Renesmee when she felt another tug, only for the girl to grab her cheeks and show her a short moment where Paul was watching her look after Renesmee with a smile, the baby soon pulled back and Riley let out a playful scowl. "Even your baby is ganging up against me, the betrayal" 2

Renesmee ignore her as she just fell forward and relaxed her head against her aunts chest, Bella watching with a fond smile on her face. "You are good with kids though, I'm not surprised if Paul wants to put a baby in you"9

"Bella!" Riley scolded with red cheeks, Bella laughing melodically as she saw her sisters fluster face. "I don't like you hanging around Jake, you always get so blunt, maybe it's the amount of brain cells you loose when you're around him" Riley sent her sister a small look only to be returned with a raised eyebrow. "Okay, hold my gorgeous niece because I have to go to work and Carlisle is giving me a lift"+

Bella stepped forward eagerly and swooped her baby in her arms, allowing Riley to finally stand up despite the cramp in her legs from being sat down so long. "Alright, have a good time then" Bella smiled, Riley returned it before she grabbed her coat that was hanging on the back of the chair, placing her arms through the sleeve before she began to button it up. She turned to see Bella's eyes only watching Renesmee in a comforting and sweet moment. +

"I will, try not to let Edward and Jake kill each other while I'm gone!"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

When Riley had finished off another day at work, she decided to go over to Paul's place for the evening, knowing that his patrol had finished a few hours earlier. She just hoped that he wasn't pigging out at Emily's house currently. +

Riley sent him a quick message about going to his as she reached outside the house, before she placed her phone in her pocket and reached up on her top toes to grab the key that was hidden on a random dip in the porch, she grabbed it quickly before settling back down on her feet and unlocking the door. +

The door opened up quickly, so she stepped inside and closed the door behind her, locking it for safety before she stepped forward.+

"Who are you?" A voice demanded, and she looked up quickly to see a woman stood there. She analysed the older woman with a confused expression, she seemed so familiar but she couldn't place just where she was from.3

"Riley" She answered quickly, "who are you and why are you in Paul's house?" She reversed the question at the woman who was stood in the middle of the living room, before Riley's eyes drifted off to a photo on the side and it clicked in her head.+

Riley had the pleasure of meeting Paul's father and step-mother, they had actually been nice to her throughout dinner and later on decided to move to a new house because they thought Paul needed his own place as he was an adult now. But, the drastic tale of the drug-life mother who abandoned her family when Paul was three, she never met, that was until this moment.+

"You're his mother" Riley breathed out, before she slowly took out her phone despite the suspicious look the woman sent to her. "I'm just going to call him". The woman nodded in agreement before Riley rang up her boyfriend, only to be put on his voicemail. "Hi Paul, erm, I'm just ringing to say that I'm at your house and—and well, I think it would be better if you just came here and saw for your self"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Paul had just finished helping Sam rearrange the spare room again, he had no idea why Sam was planning to clear out the room, but once he had stopped he decided to go downstairs and see what Emily was up to.1

"Oh! Paul!" Emily cheered out happily as she was setting some muffins down at the table. "Perfect timing, as always" Emily then started to walk towards the kitchen, only to pause as she looked back at the boy. "Your phone has been ringing by the way, I didn't want to answer it because it's your phone after all"+

Paul nodded in thanks before he reached for his phone, smiling once he saw Riley's name on his screen, he was definitely whipped.+

Riley❤️+

Hi Paul, just going over to your house. Are you atEmily's? Xxx+

Then Paul noticed that she had rang him only a few minutes later, even leaving a voicemail which he clicked play to.+

'Hi Paul, erm, I'm just ringing to say that I'm at your house and—and well, I think it would be better if you just came here and saw for your self' +

Paul tensed up when he heard her speak, she sounded worried and anxious, not forgetting scared. He glanced back to see Emily swaying in the kitchen as she was cooking more food. "Emily, I have to go see Riley, we might come over later though"+

"Alright Sweetie, say hi to her for me" She smiled gently at him, and he gave her a tight one back before he ran out of the house with such a speed that he had never done before.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"How many sugar's would you like in your tea?" Riley asked kindly as she stood in the kitchen (which was in the same room as the kitchen), the woman on the sofa sat there patiently with her hands fiddling as she awaited her son's arrival.+

"Two please" The woman smiled, and the girl nodded happily before moving to do that. The woman observed the girl quickly as she watched her dance around the kitchen, it was clear to her now that this Riley girl was dating Paul, which made her happy as Riley seemed to be one of the kindest people she had ever met in her life, which Paul needed. +

Riley brought over to tea and set it down on the coffee table in front of her with a warm expression that helped with the woman's nerves, "don't worry about Paul, he's always angry and late" The small joke brought a smile on the woman's lips. "I was terrified of him at first, but now he's like a giant teddy bear" +

The woman hummed along, "He isn't going to like me being here, especially being sat here with you" +

"If he has a problem, he can take it up with me" Riley stated bravely, "he wouldn't dare hurt me or anything, he will try his best to listen....hopefully" Riley gulped slightly as she thought over the worst scenario's that could happen, like if he shifted in front of them and accidentally hurt one of them, he wouldn't the able to live with himself.+

"Those are rare scars" The woman took notice of Riley's hand that had a giant bite mark on them, of course she new about the legends but she had hoped that it hadn't reached her son. "What did that to you?"+

"A bear" Riley answered in a heartbeat, "it happened when I went camping with my older sister" She bit her lip after her own lie and hoped that Paul would appear soon.+

"Not a wolf then?" The woman asked, and Riley's eyes snapped up at the woman instantly, the woman just hoped that it wasn't her son who had hurt her like that, she hoped that he wasn't like his father.+

"What do you..." Riley trailed off, and the door was slammed open randomly, making Riley yell at the loud noise as their attention spun to the angry man in the doorway. "Paul?" Riley asked carefully.+

"Oh thank God" He breathed out when he caught sight of her being sat there all fine and looking in perfect health. "When I got your message I thought something had happened to you and I..." his attention turned to the woman who was sat on the couch beside his girlfriend and his eyes widened at his mother.+

"Paul" Riley spoke softly as she stood up from her seat, and felty reached out towards his arm, he was much more tensed than he looked. "She came to talk to you, how about you hear her out before you decide on throwing her out?" Riley spoke softly as she rubbed his arm to sooth him, and the woman realised then and there that the connection ran deeper than just dating. +

Paul nodded carefully to his imprint, who's hand slid down his arm until it reached his hand, and she grabbed it quickly, his hand engulfing hers as his hand was bigger. She gave him a comforting squeeze as his eyes didn't move from his mother, he seemed to be in shock.+

Riley led him over to the sofa quickly, placing him down before she glanced between the pair carefully. "I'm going to go to the bedroom to give you both some privacy" Riley smiled, before she slowly pulled her hand away from Paul, who sat frozen. "Just hear her out" Riley whispered gently, before she kissed his cheek and looked back at his mother softly. "It was nice to meet you"+

"You too, Riley" The woman smiled, before Riley walked off into the bedroom silently to give them the privacy they deserved. "I like her"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            5

"The Volturi are after Renesmee?" Riley gasped once she heard the news from Athena, and she instantly sat up from her place in Paul's bed, who was still unconscious with his arm firmly around her waist. "What the hell happened? How did they find out about her?"+

"I don't know why you're acting so shocked, we always have shit happening to us. Anyway, The Cullen's family that live in...I cannot remember, one of them saw Renesmee catching a snowflake and now she's told the Volturi that she's an immortal child" Athena ranted on the other end as she ignored Emmett beside her.+

"But, she's a half-blood or whatever we're going to call it, she's got blood running through her veins" Riley spoke quickly, before she brushed Paul's arm away from her and stood up from the warm bed, deciding to walk into the living room so she didn't wake him up, once the door was shut she spoke again. "They have no evidence apart from her catching a snowflake, how is that enough to murder all of them?"+

"Beats me, anyway, we're all deciding on what to do and I think we're going to end up dragging in some allies which means...."  Athena trailed off as Riley glanced at the bedroom door.+

"The Wolves" Riley breathed out before she nodded, "alright, we'll set up a meeting or whatever but first things first, I need to dig up some stuff about Renesmee, surely this has happened before"+

"But it's unheard of, nobody has ever seen anything like this" Athena disagreed, making Riley snort.+

"Nobody had heard of shifters or vampires until two years ago, or even witches" Riley replied smoothly, only to be replied with a scoff. "I'm going for research what I can about this, you guys just focus on gaining allies or something" +

"Will do, Riles." Athena hummed, "also, I think Renesmee wants you, she's really scared because she has no idea what's going on"+

"Okay, I'll leave Paul a note and then I'll be on my way" Riley promised.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley gasped when a child came running towards her, her niece had grown again and she looked beautiful. (A/N: I'm picturing her as a child and not an iPhone) Riley caught the girl in her arms and held her close to her body. "Hi pumpkin, how are you?"8

Renesmee lifted her hands up to hold the girls cheeks, making Riley smile gently as memories flashed through her mind. She kissed the girls head playfully before she decided to walk them both towards the house, giving Seth a wave as he stood on the porch with a protective eye on Renesmee.+

"Hi Riley!" Seth greeted lightly, and Riley grinned, she was so happy that he had imprinted on her niece as she knew he'd keep her safe and happy. +

"Alright, where is Carlisle?" Riley got down to business when she entered the room where the family where all sat/stood together, they looked over to her instantly, seeing Renesmee sat in her arms happily. "I've got some research to do"+

"Riley" Bella breathed out, before she flashed over to her sister and daughter in a flash, taking them both into her arms gently. "Thank you for coming"+

"You're all my family, Bells. Where else would I be?" Riley asked with a smile, that the others returned. "Although, I think Paul might kill me when he finds out I left him while a vampire kingdom has declared war on us all" +

"Reasonable" Athena shrugged from in Emmett's arms, she was certain that he was just being clingy because of the whole Volturi thing that was going on.  "What did you do anyway?"+

"Erm" Riley boy her lip, "I left him a note saying 'Going to The Cullen's, there is another war coming, explain later' and then three kisses on the bed to try and sooth him over" Athena just shook her head at her cousins stupidity. "Oh well, there was no way he was going to stop me from helping you guys"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I can walk perfectly fine on my own Alice" Riley scowled playfully as Alice helped her climb over a few stones on a small lake in the woods, they had left when nobody had expected them to do they could go search for a hybrid that Alice had a vision about and Riley had dug up something about. +

"If I get you hurt in any way, they will all kill me" Alice mused, and Riley nodded her head as she understood how protective the family was over each other. "Now, I want you to hand the note to Sam because he'll be more willing to hear you out"+

"Sam?" Riley quizzed in confusion before the pair heard the snap of a twig, making Riley quickly lift her dagger up in defence. Riley watched as the tall figure walked out of the trees, just having changed into his cargo shorts. "Sam?" She says again, and watches as Alice holds out a note for her to take to Sam.+

Riley takes it without question before she walks over to Sam sheepishly, who nods in a silent thanks before he opens it up and reads it, his head instantly snapping to the girl. "You're leaving?"+

"I'll be back Sam, just try and keep Paul calm in the meantime" Riley smiled softly, and Sam gave her a small one back before he folded the letter back up. "I just need you to give it to them, that's all, they will understand eventually"+

"Paul's going to go mad" Sam pointed out, and Riley let out a small huff at the mention of the stubborn and hot headed man. +

"We'll be fine" Riley reassured, before she sent a quick peck to his cheek, which surprised him ultimately. "Bye Sam, good luck with Paul" She grinned cheekily before she walked over to Alice, who held out her hand to the girl. With a small flash, Alice has Riley on her back and began to run at full speed before anyone from the Coven or Pack could stop them.4


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I can't believe they just...left" Bella gasped as she read the note in her hand that Sam had delivered to them moments earlier, she snapped her eyes over to her husband. "Why would they leave like that?"3

The silence filled the room as none of them truly held an answer to the question, before they spotted Renesmee walking over to them quietly, grabbing the note from Bella's hand and smiling down at her aunt's familiar handwriting.+

"How could they leave Renesmee?" Bella had asked, making her daughter look up to her silently.+

"They didn't" Renesmee grinned, and her parents turned to her with wide eyes. "Aunt Riley said goodbye this morning" With that said, she trailed forward to her mum and placed her hands on her cheeks to show her the past.+

The door creaked open slightly as Riley struggled to get into the room silently, she couldn't find it in her to leave without saying goodbye to Renesmee. She spun around after shutting the door to see Renesmee sat up with a tilted head.+

Riley sighed, "why are you awake missy?" She walked over to the young girls bed before she sat beside her, grabbing her hand gently. The little girl put her head down sheepishly.+

"I couldn't sleep, everyone is tense" Renesmee stated, and Riley let out a small sigh before she reached forward and lifted her nieces head.+

"Aunt Alice and I have to do something important to help, can you be a good girl for your mum when I'm gone?" Riley questioned with a soft smile on her lips, Renesmee frowned at the thought of Riley being gone. "I won't be gone long, just until we need to be back, don't worry"+

"Riley, can you be safe for me?" Renesmee worded out carefully, wanting her aunt to be safe, Riley let out a large grin.+

"Only if you promise that you and your mom will look after each other, okay?" +

"Promise" Renesmee nodded her head with a big smile, before her aunt leaned forward and pressed a kiss to her head. Renesmee leaned back into her bed as her aunt tucked her in all over again, pressing another kids to her head before she turned to the door to leave.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley walked anxiously aside Alice as the power chorusing through her veins as she watched Alice make her way over to the Vampire cult leader with a high head, she hated the Volturi for everything her family had been through and she couldn't help but thirst for wanting to rip their heads off. Her niece was sat on top of Seth's wolf form, ready to run away and hide if necessary. +

Alice and Riley glanced over at the witnesses, family and Wolves who were watching them eagerly, not expecting them to have arrived at the war. The Wolves shook slightly as they caught sight of one of the imprints who had been missing for weeks, but when they saw the look on her face, they knew she had something planned.+

"Alice" The leader whispered excitedly, Edward's head filling with Alice's thought of everything, her plan was clear to him now.+

When they had reached closed enough, they were grabbed ahold of, maybe Alice gasp out in a slight struggle as Riley just sent them a warning look on where they were grabbing her.+

"My dear, dear Alice. We're so glad to see you here after all" He smiled creepily as his blood red eyes met the girl who he wanted stacked in his cult like a trophy, Riley just scolded silently at the man she had heard so terrible about. +

"I have evidence that the child won't be a risk to our kind" Alice defended quickly, nodding her head to him, wanting him to grab her hand to see what she had seen. "Let me show you"+

"Brother..." Ciaus warned slightly, but the leader ignored him as he eagerly held his hand out to the girl who pushed the body guards off of her, Riley still being held back as she glanced between her family and Alice anxiously.+

There was a few silent and am tense moment as Riley struggled slightly against the hold she had, she didn't like Alice being so close to so many of them as she risked herself.+

"It doesn't matter what I show you" Alice spoke with confidence. "Even when you see" she snapped her hand away from the man. "You still won't change your decision" Alice spins around and mouths the word 'now'.+

Seeing Seth run off with Renesmee on her back makes everyone tense as Ciaus instantly orders for the vampires to get them. Alice turns back to Aro, leaning down as she sends a strict kick to him, making his body fly backwards.+

"Oh shit" Riley breathed out as she realised what was happening, and she quickly snapped the guys hold on her before she twisted their arms backwards and went to run towards Alice quickly, only for two guys to take ahold of Alice. "Let go of her!" She shouts, alongside Carlisle, who runs forward to save his daughter.+

"Take her away" one of the leader instructs, and Riley watches as she's dragged away, making the Cullen's step forward as the Wolves growl loudly. Riley is clasped by her neck, being lifted up to the air as they strangled her, she helplessly tries to get to Alice.+

In an instant, Jasper runs forward without a doubt and rips Riley from the vampire, only to be caught himself. The vampires restrain him kicking as Riley turns her attention back to Carlisle, only to see his head being ripped off, Esme lets out a loud and painful scream onto the battle ground, significantly starting it all up.2

"Get off him" Riley let out lowly as she stepped towards the vampires hiding Jasper, chaos around her as everyone stormed towards each other. Riley flashes forward, surprising them, as she grabs one of their necks and quickly twists it in an unnatural way, Jasper fending off the others who held him down. He stand up sharply and sends her a short nod, and they spin the war in from of them. "I need to help Seth and Renesmee" Riley breathed out, knowing she had to leave her family. +

Without gaining an answer she runs across the battle field covered in bodies already, shoving anyone who got in the way of her protecting her niece, with her speed she managed to catch up easily to where they were chasing Seth and Renesmee, who was clinging to the wolf with her life.+

As a vampire went to jump on top of them, Riley jumped forward herself and pushed them into a tree, quickly ripping off their head and arms so they couldn't attack them again, she heard Renesmee squeal out her name in excitement but reminded herself of why she was there.+

"Keep going Seth!" She yelled at the wolf who glanced back at her, her hands grabbing onto a vampire who tried to grab her throat, she snapped her head forward to head it them before thrusting out her leg to trip him up, throwing down a dagger directly into his head before spinning to her next target, she ran forward with a loud yell. +

The vampire managed to twist her knee cap but she refused to back down from fighting, quickly snatching her head and bringing it with her to the floor, before she straddled her waist and stabbed her dagger several times with a battle cry.+

She huffed as she stood up once again and ran forward to through the trees, trying to find Renesmee and Seth again so she could help them get away. "Seth! Watch out!" She shouted, watching as he bit at a vampire who tried to grab the girl.+

Riley was knocked the floor suddenly by an unknown force to her left side, and she was pinned by her torso and a hand to her head, she glanced up sadly to see Renesmee and Seth watching her with sad looks. "Keep going! Don't stop running!" She shouted, Seth nodded in respect for her wishes before she clenched her eyes shut sadly, awaiting what was about to happen.+

And with a quick snap, her body fell limp against the floor, her last thoughts being how she had helped her niece get away.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"That is your future if you decide it to be" Alice confidently stated as she stood back form Aro who had just witnessed his own death, he stood in shock by what he has just witnessed, before he glanced at the family that's courage was so strong that they would die just for one child to live.5

"The child still proposes a threat" Ciaus states by Aro's side as he looked at the man with no words. 2

"But what if you were sure she could be concealed from the human world?" Edward added on, and Riley smiled inwardly to herself as she glanced at the woods nearby, giving a nod as a signal. "Could we live in peace?"+

"Of course, but that can not be known." Ciaus defended sharply, Alice walking backwards as Riley was slowly released from her hold, making Alice instantly grab the girls hand to pull her away from the body guards. +

"Actually, it can" Edward responded, and that's when everyone took notice of the two figures walking out from the trees, bringing curiously to both sides as they had no idea who Riley and Alice had brought with them. Riley sent the pair a kind smile as they reached closer, making the man give her a gentle nod in return. +

"I've been searching for witnesses of my own" Alice spoke quickly, standing head on to the Volturi as he hand remained in twined with Riley's. "Riley had found out about the legends within the Tekona tribes of Brazil"+

"We have enough witnesses—" Ciaus goes to argue, only for Aro to send him a shape glare.+

"Let them speak" Aro snaps back, silencing the man as Riley let out a small breath of relief that they were actually going to listen to them.+

"I am half human, half vampire, like the child" Nahuel speaks into the tense air as the Volturi watch him closely. "A vampire seduced my mother, who died giving birth to me, my aunt Huilen raised me as her own, I made her immortal" he states as his aunt glanced his way slightly.+

"How old are you?" Bella questions on the other side of the battle field, she was eager to know if her daughter would be safe and healthy. Obviously they could all only hear her because of their supernatural hearing plus Athena's spell. +

"150 years" Nahuel nodded at her, the Volturi leaders stepped forwards with a thirst for knowledge. +

"At what age did you meet full maturity?" Aro asked.+

"I became fully grown 7 years after my birth" He answered, glancing at Riley who gave him an encouraging smile. "I have not changed since then" Renesmee was going to be safe.+

"And your diet?" Aro quizzed.+

"Blood, human food" Nahuel listed off, "I can survive off either" Riley squeezed Alice's hand as she realised that their plan was succeeding.+

"These children are much like us..."+

"Regardless, the Cullen's have been consulting with werewolves...our natural enemies" Ciaus argues, making Riley glare slightly at him as she decides to speak next.+

"Only because one of them is my mate" Riley explains sharply, defending the Wolves who swelled in pride at the sight of her defending them against the Volturi, without even flinching at them, Aro sent her a glance of acknowledgment.6

Aro spins around to his clan, "Dear ones...there is no danger here, we will not fight today" And they all began to turn away and walk, making Alice glance back at her family with excitement, Alice had missed her mate for last couple weeks and couldn't bare to wait any longer to jump into his arms. After all the vampires has sped away, Aro had glanced back creepily for one last look. "Such a prize...." he muttered before he too was gone.+

Riley immediately let a big smile break out in her face as she let go of Alice's hand and jumped forward to hug Nahuel. "Thank you so much" the man just patted her back weakly before she pulled back from him. "Truly, thank you"+

"Riley" Alice called her name, and Riley quickly grabbed Alice's hand before they ran over to where their family was celebrating.+

"Riles!" Bella breathed out as she dived towards her sister, squeezing her heavily. "Never do that again! You scared me half to death!" Bella scolded, her arms not letting go of her sister.+

"I kind of need my arms Bells" Riley complained as she was stuck against her sister, who quickly let go of her with a small gasp, Riley then reached up and pressed a kiss to Edward's cheek. "Thank you for keeping her safe, and my niece of course" Edward sent her a warm smile quickly in response.+

"Riley!" Someone else shouted and she turned to see the women's coming out one by one in a pair of shorts they had put on, and she grinned at the sight of her imprint, her legs took off on their own as she eagerly ran forward to his arms, him running just as fast as he craved her touch. +

Their bodies collided quickly as his arms engulfed her full body against his warm chest, his arms circling her waist tightly as she clung to his torso. A piece of her came back as she was finally in the arms of her boyfriend who she loved dearly, her nose filling with the scent of his muscular wood smell, his head dipping into her neck as he started to place soft kisses against her. +

"You're not allowed to leave me ever again" Paul growled out as he held her closer, praising himself as he heard a giggle come out of her, he let his eyes close in their peaceful moment. "Never again"+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"I told you I'm not doing it!" Riley shouted in defence as she stood with her arms crossed and her eyes flared, Paul just met her temper.+

"Well, I am certainly not doing it! You're the one who found it!" He yelled back, his arms folding themselves as he copied her stance. "I'm not doing it Riley, no way"+

"Well somebody has to get that freaky legged thing!" Riley poured out as she wafted her arms around. +

A few minutes prior Riley had pointed out a spider while she screamed loudly at it, alarming Paul in the process, who quickly threw his imprint over his shoulder before he ran the pair into the only room with a lock. The bathroom. Which they were now stuck in because neither of them had the strength to get rid of it.+

"You're the wolf!" Riley suddenly pointed out with a smirk, causing him to roll his eyes at her, as they grew older the pack was slowly giving up their shifting, Leah had been the first one to give up as she wanted to settle down with her imprint, Riley and Paul had yet to get married as they had only moved in together so far, enjoying the simplicity of just being in each other's company.+

Nobody quite knew why Paul hadn't popped the question yet, as they were sure that they would be right after Emily to get married. And yet, Emily now has a baby and there is still no ring, it made Riley really insecure around the other imprints, everyone was heavily married or pregnant while she couldn't sort out who got rid of a spider with Paul.+

"Fine, I'll get it" Riley caved in finally, her eyes turning sad as she remembered something, pulling her away from Paul yet again which made him turn sad in an instant. +

Riley grabbed a cup that was usually left in the bathroom for late night drinks, before she grabbed a magazine that was laying around, unlocking the door before she stepped out quickly and made her way down the stairs to see if it was still near the couch. She didn't even flinch when she saw it's creepy legs twitching, just placed the cup on top of it before she quickly shifted the magazine under it, walking towards the back door where she let it walk away.+

Riley slammed the cup into the sink and threw the magazine in the bin, not even noticing Paul watching her with confusing eyes. "What did I do Rile?" He finally asked, making her tense slightly.+

"What makes you think you've done something?" Riley replied with suspicion, turning around to face him, her eyes glaring slightly as she tries to figure out why he had thought he had done something. Leah had offered a reason as to why he hadn't made any other moves, and Riley physically felt her heart break as she thought about it again. "A-are you..." +

"Am I what?" Paul asked, before he saw Riley's eyes drop to the floor with water pooling in the bottom of them. "Riley, I can't do anything if you don't tell me"+

Riley snapped her head up sharply, "I-I just...do you not want me or something?" His chest felt tight at her statement, he was ultimately confused. "I mean, everyone in the pack is married or expecting children and you just...we've been living together for a few years now and I can't help but think that you no longer want me to be in your future. You haven't even given up shifting yet, even if everyone else has"+

"Riley" Paul sighed softly at the state of her, and she brushed away a stray tear as her head dropped and she nodded carefully. +

"I get it, I'll pack my things." Riley replied in a monotone voice, moving to step forward, only for Paul's hands to reach forward and push her against the wall quickly. She let out a gasp as he held her gently against the wall, her eyes raising to his with a questioning expression. "What are you doing?!"+

"Riley, I gave up my wolf a few weeks ago" Paul admits, smiling down at her softly as she tired to figure it all out, he loved her expression whenever she was working out something in her mind, the crease in her brows as her eyes dazed slightly.+

"Why?" She tilted her head slightly as she analysed his face, trying not to think about kissing the life out of him. +

"Because, I want our future together Riley" Paul began to explain, "but I didn't want us getting married around the same time as everybody else, being just 'another wedding' that people attend, I want it to be special and lasting" +

"You want to get married?" Riley questioned carefully, her face becoming more soft and relaxed.+

"Of course Riley, you're the love of my life, why wouldn't I want to marry you?" He questioned with a smile on his lips, his hands brushing her hair and caressing her cheek as she just held onto his arms gently. "You just had to interfere with my plan to surprise you" without her getting the chance to speak, he realised his hold on her and pulled out a black matte box to her with a sheepish expression. +

Riley gasped as he flicked it open for her eyes, glancing down at it before she looked back at his nervous expression, before she quickly dived forward and laced her lips with his, Paul returning it quickly as he held her against his body. Silently, he slid the ring onto her finger before dropping the box to the ground and trailing his hands to her thighs, her body jumping up for him to catch her.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

Riley squealed as she ran around on the beach with a wide smile written on her face, she was being chased down by Paul as she ran with her nephew Chris (the son of Emmett and Athena Cullen) as Athena was already supernatural and they knew more from Bella's birth, Athena had the chance to a healthy pregnancy and even ended up having two pregnancies, before she decided to be turned to a vampire. 1

The babies were much like Renesmee but had a slower growth rate, as they were half warlock. So far, only the youngest and gained powers.+

"Lets get them Soph" Paul let out a cheeky grin as the girl sat on his back, clinging on to his neck as they chased the pair ahead of them. "We're going to get you!" He called out to his wife and nephew, his niece laughing on his back as she silently watched her family running around. "Be ready Soph, you should tag Chris!"+

"Yes Uncle Pauly" Soph cheered out loudly, having a similar volume to her dad who was considered loud, her blonde hair waved in the wind as he uncle picked up his speed suddenly, erupting a loud giggle from the five year old. "Woo!"+

Chris, after noticing how much fun the girl was having, pouted as he stopped running all together. "Hey! I want a piggy back too!" He pouted as Riley came to a stop next to him. "Aunt Ri! Piggy back!" He demanded from her with his mother's stubborn nature.+

"Oh, erm..." Riley trailed off as she didn't know how to answer it, before she was stepped off her feet by her knight in shinning armour, who walked her over to the water with a playful grin. +

"Princess Sophia has demanded her ultimate punishment of the....water drop!" Paul let out dramatically as he went to lower Riley into the water, but she shivered and cling closer to his neck, knowing the water was freezing to death.+

"No, Paul! Don't put me in the water!" She begged, but Paul didn't pick up on the undertone of urgency, and he lowered her into the water quickly. She quickly stood up on the water as she began to shiver from the temperature, making her way to the shore silently as she didn't send a glance toward Paul. +

"Aunt Ri, are you okay?" Sophia asked innocently as she jumped off of her brother whom she had tackled to the sand, she quickly placed her hands on her aunts arms, sending a wave of warmth to the woman using her powers.+

Riley's summer dress clung to her, revealing something she had kept hidden for a few months. "Riley?" Paul breathed out as he caught sight of the small bump on her stomach, and she glanced at him in confusion before she looked down at her belly, slowly lifting her hand to it an instant.+

"Oh" Riley smiled sheepishly, before she looked up at her gob smacked husband. "Paul? Are you okay?" She questioned, gesturing for the kids to make some sand castles as she walked forward and grabbed Paul's cheeks. "Paul Lahote, you answer me right now"+

"You're pregnant" Paul stated as he let out a small gasp, resurfacing to reality as he looked down at her stomach, placing his hand gently on it to remind himself its real. "Oh my god, that's our baby" Paul seems to be in shock higher than any sort of anger, and Riley grinned once she noticed that he had a smile on his lips, the baby distracting him away from any anger or hurt from her hiding it from him.+

"Paul, just know that it's only been a month a around with weeks, Carlisle said that the first eleven weeks are extremely risky and that I could loose the baby easier than any other time during pregnancy, and I didn't want to get your hopes up or anything..." Riley quickly explained herself, and Paul snapped his eyes up to her face, looking suddenly confident.+

He swung his hands under her legs and lifted her up into his arms quickly, "we shouldn't be out in the cold then! What were you even thinking? Kids, let's get you home! Aunt Ri needs to warm up and rest!"+

Oh good, he was going to be an overprotective ass during this whole thing.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

Riley bursted out crying in her struggle, not being able to reach her foot so she could put her fluffy socks on, tears streamed down her cheeks as she wailed loudly. Footsteps became loud as someone ran into hers and Paul's room, and she looked up through her watery eyes to spot her twins in front of her.+

"Mom, what happened?" Violet questioned quickly, and Riley let out a cry again as she pointed her sock on the floor out to the ten year old, who instantly fell to the floor to help her mother put the sock on. "Jay, go get some strawberries for her"+

The quiet boy nodded shapely before he ran out of the room after gaining his twins orders, he had often been really quiet his whole life, even as a baby. He often only spoke to people when it was a one-to-one conversation with someone he was close with. Like his mother, sister and sometimes his dad if he needed to.+

"It's okay mom" Violet reassured with her father's soft side that she had inherited, the hot headed girl was usually a snappy and snarky girl in school, but her walls crumbled the second she was around her mother and twin, and sometimes when her dad wasn't being stubborn himself. "See? The socks on, nice and cozy"+

"Thank you, Violet" Riley breathed out through her tears, her daughter reaching forward to brush away her mother's tears, Riley was on her third pregnancy and this had been the most emotional one yet for some reason. "Where's your sister?"+

Violet rolled her eyes, "Sarah is out playing with Levy" Levy was Jared and Kim Cameron's youngest child who was the same age as Sarah, Riley and Kim swore that they were destined to be imprints because of the connection the pair had, but Paul was furious of the idea of Jared's son getting with his daughter.+

Sarah's was a daddy's girl, which he absolutely loved considering the twins preferred their mother, alongside most of their friends kids and their nieces and nephews, Riley found it amusing how she was the favourite.1

"Great! She needs an influence other than Harry" Who was Leah's son who was a total rascal who didn't take anything to his head, he just rebelled against everything even though he was only eighteen years old, she didn't like that influence on Sarah. +

"Tell me about it" Violet agreed with a small hum before her twin appeared around the corner of the doorway with a bowl full of chocolate covered strawberries, walking forward to hand it to his mother proudly.+

"Thank you Jay" Riley praised, kissing the boys cheek who smiled at the affection before he stepped back and grabbed his twins hand. "What are you two up to today? Because I'm not going to let your dad pay you to be babysitters, I'm capable of looking after myself"+

"Even if we wanted to leave, dad would kill us" Violet pointed out. "Now watch those crime documentaries and eat your strawberries" Violet instructed sharply, kissing her mom's head as she helped her settle down into bed, she then walked out of the room.3

"Love you" Jay spoke softly, reaching forward to kiss his mom's cheek before he quickly ran after his twin, not wanting to be away from her for too long as he didn't have any friends of his own. The door shut behind the twins and Riley rolled her eyes at violet's behaviour, she was too much like her father it hurt. 1

But, she shook off the thought as she lifted a strawberry up to her mouth and took a huge bite, clicking play on her crime show she was currently watching.+


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

"Well, if you decide not to wear it then how is Claire going to see you looking all cute and dapper?" Riley questioned her three year old son who stood there with a pout on his lips, his arms crossed as he refused to wear a jacket with his cute shirt. "Do you not have a crush on Claire anymore?"+

"I love her!" The boy yelled out in defence, apparently her had been in love with a girl from his nursery, they had met when he was two and he had been obsessed with her ever since, always wanting to impress her. +

"Okay darling" Riley sighed in defeat, "will you at least where this jacket for your mom?" Riley asked softly, the doe-eyed, curly-haired boy stared up at her until he gave another pout.+

"Yes mommy" He agreed, swinging his arm in one of the sleeves as Riley held it up from him to get into, he placed the other one in before he spun around to face her, letting her zip it up for him.+

"There you go, you look handsome" Riley smiled gently, pressing a kiss to her sons head, who pretended to cringe.+

"Mommy! I'm a big boy!" He argued, pretending to wipe off the kiss and rub it onto his jeans. "Dad tell her!" He turned to his dad whom was sat leaning against the table watching his family with loving eyes, he loved watching Riley's moments with the kids, it didn't even bother him that they preferred her more than him. He just likes seeing them all happy together, his loving family. "Fine! I'll tell Levy to!" He exclaimed before he ran off with his tiny feet, his curls bouncing every step of the way.+

"You shouldn't listen to everything your sisters boyfriend says!" Paul shouts to his son who disappears up the stairs to where Levy is probably hiding from Paul in Sarah's room, the two twelve year olds started dating recently and Paul was still livid.+

"Leave Levy alone, he's an amazing boy" Riley scolded as she stood up from her crouching position, walking over to her his sand instead, who instantly hooked their hands together and made it so she was leaning against him, she smiled against his chest as she leaned her forehead on him. +

"I still don't like him" Paul states, Riley lifting her head up to Paul, who leans his head against hers, the pair smiling at each other. "I love you, Riley Lahote"1

"I love you too, Paul Lahote" Riley smiled, leaning forward to kiss him, they were cut off by running steps into the room and a voice saying 'mom!'.+

Riley and Paul pulled away to see Jay stood there sheepishly, as he had noticed his dad was there too which made him coil into his emotional shell he owned, Riley instantly walked towards Jay, forgetting her husband entirely. +

"What wrong, dear?" She questioned the 14 year old who had red cheeks, "what happened? Are you okay?" She placed her hands on the boys cheeks as she checked him over slightly, the boy glanced at his dad to see if he was close enough to hear them.+

"Erm, Harry" He began tensely, not liking his dad being too close. "Sit next to me in history" He trailed off slightly as he saw his dad step closer to them, "I don't want him near me" Harry had been somewhat teasing Jay for a while now, never stopping even when Leah had threatened him numerous times, although Paul just thought Harry secretly had a crush on the older boy, as the teasing was never usually mean, just observations. Jay easily blushed over any type of compliment or observation as he liked to seem invisible, it was more comforting to him, but Harry frustrated him so much and he never understood why.3

"If he says anything else then you can tell Aunt Athena" Riley promises, knowing that her cousin could scare Harry to the point of no return, she'd make sure that the woman wouldn't do too much though. Jay nodded as a thanks, making Riley kiss his cheek. "Now go get your siblings and Levy, we need to drive you all to school"+

Jay nodded once more and kissed her cheek before he ran off towards the stairs, leaving Riley waiting for the children to hurry up so she could take them away for the day, Paul's day off.+

"I was thinking...." Paul trailed off as he circled his arms around her waist. "You drop the kids off and come back and then I can take you to your mystery date I have set up" He offered, kissing and biting at her neck playfully, making her giggle at his behaviour.+

"Paul, not now" Riley breathed out, before she could hear the footsteps trampling down the stairs loudly, and Paul kissed her neck one more time as he mutters a 'later'. Riley pushes his head away from her and swoops down to pick up her youngest from Levy's arms, who kissed her cheek as a greeting. "Thank you Levy, let's all go now"+

"Step on my foot one more time and I'll steal your charger again!" Violet warned Sarah's when the girl accidentally stepped on her foot.+

"Sorry!" Sarah apologised quickly, Levy taking her hand softly into his to reassure her, Violet's eyes softened at her sister before she shrugged it all off.4

So, first things first I wanted to ask you guys if you had any questions about this book.4

Choice is all yours.+
