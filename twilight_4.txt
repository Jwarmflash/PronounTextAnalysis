as of February 2022, this entire series has been edited/rewritten. so any new people don't get confused by the old comments. as for those who are returning—hope you enjoy the changes.13

N O T E+

some of you may not like Bailey in the first couple of chapters (or in this first book) and that's okay. after all, she is "arrogant and straightforward" and so a lot of times she does do or say the right things. keep in mind that she's fifteen years old and at the start of the story not everything about her is revealed just yet. 32

so yeah, just wanted to add this here so that people get the full picture before they begin this story. Bailey's character does slowly get better as she observes and learns from the people around her. +

this is the story of her development and her growth as a person.  3

  THERE WERE SOME BATTLES THAT were pointless fighting against. Bailey Swan was well aware of that. If the outcome was futile why waste energy engaging in pointless conflict? This was of course referring to the unexpected uprooting of Bailey's life that had been completely decided by her mother, Renée Dwyer (previously Renée Swan). Renée was a giddy woman, wild and obsessed with so-called "freedom", she was spontaneous, always laughing and a bit immature and childish. More importantly, Renée was in love with her new husband Phil Dwyer. Bailey hardly ever saw her stepfather, as he was a minor league baseball player, he spent the majority of his time away. Bailey had no opinions on Phil—he was barely around so other than a few encounters when he started dating her mother she hardly knew him as a person. Even though her mother never showed it, Phil's constant absence bothered her—she wanted to be with him but instead stayed home to tend to her two daughters. 5

"I have an idea," said a voice, one exceptionally humid afternoon in Arizona. 1

Bailey paused in her literature readings, her gaze lifting just over her book cover as she spotted her older sister, Isabella. 35

Isabella, or Bella as she preferred, was Bailey's older sister by two years. Despite them being sisters and living under the same roof for the entirety of their lives they hardly talked to one another. Both Bailey and Bella were quiet people who didn't speak unless spoken to and they two had nothing in common. Bella was more of an indie girl, sensitive, clumsy and average all around. Bailey was a nerd, hostile, always had her nose in a book or was critiquing those whom she deemed to be inferior. They hardly ever talked to one another if it wasn't the occasional "good morning", "are you wearing my sweater" or "pass the salt". 60

"Go on," Bailey replied, studying her sister's body language. She watched closely as Bella's eyes flickered around the room to avoid staring Bailey in the eye, she shifted her weight from one leg to the other and tucked her dark brown hair behind her ear. Bailey noted that the two of them talking to one another was so rare that it was physically making Bella uncomfortable—as if she were talking to a stranger. 14

"I, uh, think we should move in with Charlie," Bella didn't beat around the bush. "Mom's been missing Phil like crazy and they haven't been married that long, you know, so they should be able to spend more time together. I think she wants to travel with him but feels like she shouldn't leave us behind. W-what do you think?" +

"Okay," was all Bailey said before she resumed reading. She knew it didn't matter whether she agreed or disagreed with Bella's "idea", after all, Bella hadn't been asking for her permission she just wanted her opinion. That made it clear to Bailey that no matter what she said Bella was going to bring the idea up to their mother, who would leap at the opportunity to be with her new husband, whom she was utterly infatuated with. +

That was the last time Bailey and Bella spoke to one another for a while—again, it wasn't that they hated each other or had bad blood, they simply didn't have anything to talk about and neither one chose to take the initiative. 49

The weeks dragged along and soon Bailey and her sister were on a plane flying from Pheonix Arizona to Forks Washington where their father Charlie Swan lived. The flight went by fairly quickly given that Bailey spent most of her time transported to the land of Hogwarts. Her eyes were glued to the pages of her Harry Potter book (Goblet of Fire to be exact), entranced by each word on the page that she didn't notice the plane had landed and people were slowly beginning to exit. 73

"Bailey, let's go." 5

Bella had tapped her sister's shoulder dragging her mind back to reality. Bailey's blue eyes left the pages for the first time since Arizona. She looked at Bella, then at the carry-on bag she was holding, and the seat she had now left empty. Bailey slide her the holographic bookmark she had won in her first-grade spelling bee between the pages of her book, before shutting it and rising from her seat. 14

Bella handed Bailey her bag and the sisters exited the plane—being the last two passengers to do so. +

 The reunion of the Swans went as to be expected for three people who were quiet and introverted—it was awkward. Bailey and Bella hadn't seen their father for years and so meeting him again was nice but also a bit jarring. How were they supposed to call this strange man father after spending almost no time with him at all? 40

Bailey could tell that Charlie, her father, might have been hoping for a better reaction—she just wasn't sure how to portray the proper emotion that would bring him some sort of satisfaction and still feel natural to her. She usually had difficulty with that, displaying proper human emotion while still seeming genuine. Most of the time Bailey had a blank look on her face because it felt the most comfortable—this had earned her the nickname "the robot" from some of her classmates (it didn't help they also thought she had the mind of a computer).  40

The drive back to their father's house was silent and nostalgic. For a little while, Bailey had been looking outside the window, watching the seemingly familiar scenery pass by. She hadn't been in Forks since she was a child. The greys skies, dewy atmosphere, and smell of woodland areas were igniting her senses, she felt like a child again visiting her dad during summer break... 1

When Charlie tried to engage in conversation with Bella, who was sitting next to him in the passenger seat, Bailey pulled out her Harry Potter book again and went back to reading. Bella's half-hearted, enthusiastic response to Charlie's attempt at conversation led him to turn his attention to his youngest daughter. 9

"So, Bailey," he paused, glancing at the fifteen-year-old through his review mirror. "You got new glasses?" 1

The pair she was wearing presently were different from the ones she had as a child. When she was younger Bailey wore these rectangular-shaped, thin, mauve-coloured glasses that looked hideous on her face. Bailey wasn't even one who cared too much about her looks, but whenever she saw old photos of herself wearing those ugly glasses she had to fight the urge to throw up. These days she wore a larger more rounded pair of clear glasses with a slightly thicker frame; that is whenever she didn't feel like wearing contacts. 31

Bailey's eyes flickered up to meet Charlie's in the review mirror. +

 "Yes. That's right." was all she said before she looked back down at her book, and flipped the page. 94

Charlie nodded once with his eyes settling back on the open road. Now that they were coming to live with him, he had ample time to get his daughters to speak to him, there was no use in trying to rush anything if they weren't comfortable with it. 15

When the squad car came to a stop they had arrived at their destination. 1

The house looked the exact same from what Bailey could remember. Her memories were still a bit hazy, she could only recall bits and pieces considering she was only around four or five years old at the time. Some things were different than what Bailey had experienced all those years ago. For instance, she now got to have her own room, unlike before when she had to share with Bella. Bailey felt an invisible weight lift from her shoulders when she heard Charlie say they would be getting their own rooms. Bailey didn't like to share, she liked to be on her own and have her own space. Even when she was younger she hated having to share with Bella. 28

  BAILEY HATED BEING A MORNING person. Her body just naturally woke up early no matter how late she slept the night before. Bailey liked to sleep, in fact, it was one of her favourite pastimes. But, unfortunately, her body simply had other plans for her. Now there was always the possibility of falling back asleep until she was ready to wake up, right? Wrong! It was virtually impossible for Bailey to fall asleep once she had woken up. It didn't matter if it was still dark outside or if she was in a comfortable position or if her eyes were shut and she was trying with all her might to will her body sleep. Once she was awake, she was awake. Bailey had to learn to just not fight it and begrudgingly become a morning person. 49

That early morning she dragged herself out of bed and stretch out her body for a good two minutes before she walked downstairs from the attic to shower and brush her teeth. During this time of peace and tranquillity, Bailey thought of the day that she had ahead of her. Today was her first day of school. She'd be attending Forks High School as a junior—even though she was just fifteen. Bailey had moved upgrades a long time ago and technically speaking she should have already graduated by now but the previous school administration and counsellors advised against this for her own benefit. Apparently it would be more beneficial if she stayed around kids close to her age during her pivotal developmental years. 47

Bailey hated school—for social reasons. She hated the people; the students who cared more about looks, friendships or romantic relationships over the pursuit of their education. The select few teachers that tried so hard to be liked by their students ended up just embarrassing themselves. 36

She dried her hair as she walked by to her room. +

Hopefully, she would have all advanced placement (A.P) classes so she would be surrounded by fellow intellectuals. Maybe one of them could be a rival to her—Bailey stopped mid-thought due to almost bursting out in laughter. Who was she kidding? She'd never met anyone as smart as her before and she was sure someone like that wasn't hiding in Forks of all places. 64

Despite being the first one in the house to awaken Bailey was the last one to make it downstairs seeing as she had lost track of time while reading again. Luckily she had planned ahead in case this happened and set an alarm to remind her of the time. She made her way down the flight of stairs, heading toward the kitchen for some breakfast. +

"Morning, Bailey," Charlie said with a smile when he saw her enter the room. +

Bailey glanced up from the book she had in her hands, she had hoped reading would bring her spirits up. Her eyes locked with her fathers, and she flashed him a quick smile before looking back down at the story in front of her. She had noticed the slight pain that flashed through Charlie's eyes.125

"I see you're wearing the time turner I got you," he pointed out. 3

Bailey admired her time turner then started to make herself a bowl of cereal. +

"I'm never taking it off," she admitted. 15

Charlie tried to hide a smile but failed miserably at it. 28

Once both girls had finished their breakfast, they each got up from their seats and placed their dirty dishes in the sink. They each uttered short goodbyes to Charlie and then head out the front door to start their commute to school. The entire way there Bailey had her nose deep in her book, while Bella had her eyes on the road—they did not say a word to one another. +

⍣ ೋ13

Bailey hadn't even put much thought into how different attending a small school was going to be in comparison to her old one. Forks High School had a combined population of three hundred and fifty-seven—now three hundred and fifty-nine students. Small towns meant tight communities, more social interaction. The kids had known one another for years, they had grown up together and now Bailey and Bella were these foreign invaders... That much was apparent given how every pair of eyes was staring at their truck as they pulled into the school parking lot. 31

The staring worsened as Bailey and Bella got out of their ride. Bailey knew what it was like to have a lot of people staring at her. She had previously attended many national spelling bees, international science fairs, athletics competitions amongst other things. But in those circumstances she wanted people to be staring at her—the more people witnessed her academic prowess the better. This situation was different, these were just small-town kids being nosy. 1

She tried to ignore the stare while walking with Bella toward the entrance of the school. +

"Nice ride," some guy said as they walked past a group of boys. 9

"Thanks," Bella said awkwardly, glancing at the guy once before looking away. +

Escape had not been found once they entered the school's walls. People were still staring and arguably it was worse than before now that they were in a more confined space. Bailey tried to ignore them all, already preparing to whip out her book and start disassociating from her reality. However, something in her peripheral vision caught her attention—some guy was making his way over to them with a large smile on his face as if they were supposed to know who he was. 10

He was tall (around six-foot), had east-Asian features and greasy black hair. He started talking but Bailey frankly wasn't paying attention to the words coming out of his mouth, she was too busy sizing him up. The boy was like her—a nerd, no he was more of a geek. From the looks of it, he had the build of a chess player. 6

His height isn't anything to be intimidated by, Bailey analyzed the boy, I could definitely demolish him at chess. 28

Bailey had a bit of a tendency to be competitive with these sorts of things. 2

"What about you?" the boy's face directed toward Bailey got her attention. +

"Pardon?" +

"D'you mind being a feature in the school paper?" he asked, hopefully. It would seem that Bella had shut him down about writing about her and now he had turned his sights onto Bailey—who continued to look undoubtedly disinterested in everything that was being said. 2

What did he even expect to write about her? It was her first day at school and it wasn't like Bailey was going to sit down and give an interview as if her life was all that interesting. If she was going to be featured in the school paper it was going to be for important matters—preferably matters that highlighted her superior intellect. She didn't want to be on the front page of merely... existing. +

"No," said Bailey after a long while. She had to stop herself from saying what was truly on her mind because whenever she did that people would call her "cruel" or "mean" just because she was stating facts that people didn't like to hear. 7

The boy, who Bailey had finally learned was named Eric, showed the Swan sisters to the front office before heading to his first period. There Bailey and Bella were able to get the class schedules and figure out how this year was going to look for them. They had a total of two classes together those being P.E and Biology all of Bailey's other classes were advanced placements just like she had hoped. 8

Bailey's first-class was twelfth-grade A.P History (she had already gotten the credit for eleventh-grade history last year) while Bella had English so they went their separate ways for the time being. Bailey's history class was located on the second floor of the building so before anything else, she had to find where the staircase to get to the second floor. Fortunately, there was a floor plan not too far away from a fire extinguisher that hung on one of the walls in the hallway. Bailey looked it over, seeing that she had actually passed the staircase while making her way over to the floor plan and doubled back. 3

By the time she made it to the second floor, Bailey was very much late to class, it being the first time she had bever been late to class before. Bailey was a punctual person, she prided herself on her punctuality and now her perfect attendance record had been shattered all because of a stupid new school and a stupid hidden staircase! 12

Bailey was a bit pissed off as she looked for her room number, room 206—and of course, the room numbers weren't in order because why make anything easy anymore right? 4

She walked into class emitted angry vibes and much like when she first arrived at school, the head in class turned to stare at her as if she were a zoo attraction. She took a brisk look around trying to see if there were any free seats, but this was a small school and so the space was very limited. +

"Miss Swan, you're late," her teacher said. 26

Now Bailey would be the first to admit that she is a teacher's pet, it was the best way to get extra credit on assignments but at that moment she was annoyed, angry, and a little bit hungry because she hadn't eaten that much cereal before leaving for school. She turned to her teacher, a five-foot-nine middle-aged man—her eyes went dark as she opened her mouth to speak...4

"Sorry, sir, I got lost," she said calmly unexpectedly feeling as though her negative emotions had just melted away into oblivion. 40

"Very well, because it's you're the first time you only get a warning. Don't make it a habit of being late to my classes Miss Swan," he said in a tone that almost implied that he didn't believe her. 16

Bailey almost scoffed. Did he just assume she was some delinquent or something? Her eyes narrowed slightly—ooh she couldn't wait to see the look on his face when the time would come for her to correct him, and Bailey was certain that time would come; it always did. 5

"Have a seat next to Mr. Hale," the teacher waved her off, without introducing himself or pointing how who "Mr. Hale" was because Bailey had no idea who the people were. 58

She looked around the room hoping that the guy would just raise his hand or something—he did not. Bailey started walking toward the desks and eventually just settled at one of the empty ones which happened to be beside an older-looking boy. He was sitting down but Bailey could tell that he was tall. He was visibly muscular but lean under the thin fabric of this cotton shirt, he had curly honey-blond hair (that kind of looked like ramen noodles), pale white skin, and bruise-like purple shadows under his eyes that were so golden they looked like liquid topaz. 48

He was beautiful—like otherworldly beautiful that Bailey found herself wondering how she appeared in comparison. Also, he didn't move, at all. Instead, he sat there stiff as a board and staring forward not paying attention to anything other than the teacher's lesson. +

So this is Mr. Hale? Bailey thought; she looked away from him. He's weird. 35

   BAILEY HAD PHYSICAL EDUCATION BEFORE lunch. P.E was without a shred of a doubt Bailey's least favourite class. Some may argue that P.E is the easiest class to get an A in but Bailey would disagree. Anything that had to do with physical fitness or sports Bailey was terrible at and when she was bad at something Bailey despised it with a passion consequently abandoning it completely. Bailey hardly ever participated in P.E making it constantly her lowest grade every year always resting at an A (or 90-95%); it was honestly so embarrassing for her. Besides sweating was disgusting to Bailey; it was primitive. They weren't cavemen or neanderthals anymore so why would any modern human being want to exhaust their body by running around like animals? 85

The sport that they were playing today in class was volleyball probably one of the worst sports because of the constant movement. Why so much squatting? Why were they using the small Olympic-sized ball (those were so hard)? Why so much jumping? What if the ball hit her in the face and she suffered severe brain damage? Bailey had a multi-million dollar brain—well not yet, but someday in her future, she could guarantee her brain would be worth a pretty penny. She couldn't risk damaging something so valuable. 53

"Give me one good reason why I should drag you onto that court right now!" Coach Clapp, the gym teacher yelled in Bailey's face when he saw her sitting on the bleachers drinking from her water bottle as if she had done something. 28

Bailey wiped away the spit that had flown on her face. She looked off to the side to spot the divided gymnasium. For those who wanted to play volleyball on the side, this section was mostly comprised of girls. The other half of the gym was filled with people playing basketball, where most of the boys found themselves to be. 1

"I'm on my period." Bailey lied through her teeth. Coach Clapp, who happened to be a man, his nose scrunched up in discomfort. 181

"Hm, well, you—you can sit this out then," he stammered, his fast splotchy and pink with embarrassment. Bailey merely stared back at him with a blank expression and he cleared his throat and went back to refereeing the game. 2

For the rest of the class, Bailey was in pure bliss as she sat back and read from her book instead of playing sports until the end of the period. Bailey was the first person to exit the gym and the only one who didn't have to take a shower because she wasn't a sweaty mess. All Bailey did was change out of her gym clothes and make her way to her locker to fetch her lunch. 5

⍣ ೋ+

Bella managed to locate Bailey when she was putting her clothes in her locker and switching them out for her food. Bella quickly walked up to her—"Bailey." 5

Bailey paused, turning to face Bella while shutting her locker. This was new. Bella hadn't ever made any attempts to talk to her at school before, even back in Arizona. Why was she doing it now? Bailey thought that they had a mutual agreement to act as though they didn't know each other when at school. In actuality, other than their identical last names, Bailey and Bella looked nothing alike so people hardly ever thought they were related. +

"Hm?" Bailey leaned against her locker waiting to see what Bella had to say. Maybe it was something important? +

"Do you want to, uh, sit with me during lunch?" Bella asked her uncertainly. 3

For a brief moment, Bailey might have believed that Bella was extending the offer because it was a foreign environment for both of them and it might be more comfortable if they stuck together. However, she spotted Eric at the end of the hall, while looking over Bella's shoulder Bailey was able to deduce that Bella didn't want to be alone with such a talkative person. +

Bailey had already been planning to eat her lunch alone—she needed some time to research her own social battery. As a result, Bailey shook her head at Bella's invitation. 5

"I think I'll be fine, thank you," she told her and walked away looking for somewhere other than the crowded cafeteria to eat her lunch. She didn't have anything heavy or messy to eat so Bailey settled on the library to have her lunch. 30

She hid her food under her sweater when she passed the library, given that there was an enormous "NO FOOD OR BEVERAGES" sign plastered on the doors of the library. Bailey went to the far end of the room, went into the non-fiction section of the library, took a seat in one of the empty aisles and pulled out her book with her lunch. +

Bailey had a BLT sandwich on multigrain bread with a mixture of different fruit slices for dessert. She leaned her back against the heavy bookcase and brought her knees up to her chest as she ate in the comfortable silence of the library. By this time Bailey was already nearing the end of Goblet of Fire. She had already arrived at the second in which Harry Potter was teleported via portkey to the graveyard—Bailey always found her mind reacting negatively to this particular chapter, mostly because of Cedric Diggory's death. 61

She knew that it made her sad but her body just didn't react to it. Just another example of Bailey not being sure how to express the emotions she felt. She couldn't remember the last time she had cried when something made her sad—it was probably when she was a baby. 37

The sound of shuffling feet in front of her made Bailey drop an apple slice (having finished her sandwich). She looked up from the book pages. Strangely enough, she didn't see anyone no one standing in front of her. Bailey glimpsed around, attentively, then she noticed him. He was in the aisle next to hers, she could see him through an opening that was created by a few missing books on the shelf. It was the same guy from her History class—Mr. Hale with the ramen noodles hair. 49

He'd been watching her. Bailey could tell because when he noticed that she had detected him he looked away instantly and pretended as though he was searching for a book on said shelf. The only problem was that he was in the Latin section and Bailey doubted that he knew how to read the dead language. She observed him, amused at his attempt to look inconspicuous. He had purposely furrowed his eyebrows and was just randomly tracing the spines of the books to make it appear as though he was in deep thought and searching for something in particular. 21

At that moment he glanced her way again and Bailey just peered back at him with her natural blank expression. At the time she didn't know, of course, didn't know that he was curious. Curious as to why he could feel positive emotions emitting from her and yet saw no changes in her physically. For instance, presently, he could tell she was feeling joyous and amused—but her body language was apathetic, her eyes stagnant, no laughter not even a smile. 23

The bell rang signally at the end of lunch and the two looked away from one another. Bailey shut her container of fruit and shoved it in her pocket as she got up from her seat on the ground and walked away without a comment or second glance at Mr. Hale. She was a bit suspicious of him though—mostly because of his looks. Why was he so beautiful, so frighteningly beautiful? Also, he was so pale, did he never step foot outside? He was almost translucent! Did he always go to the library for lunch or had he just followed her? +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            11

   RESPECTING SOMEONE'S ALONE TIME COULDN'T possibly be that difficult, could it? Bailey didn't think so. Of course, she was never one to make the move conversation/confrontation-wise; Bailey wasn't an instigator. Sometimes people needed to be left alone and Bailey thought that her older sister, Bella, understood this. After all, Bella was the type of person who kept to herself. But unfortunately, it seemed as though her little time in Forks had already begun to change her ways. +

Bailey had been in her room reading, as she normally did, enjoying her alone time and the silence. Out of nowhere, she heard rapid footsteps running up the stairs to the attic and suddenly Bella was standing in her room. Bailey gaze over the top of her book to look at Bella, uncertain as to why she had barged in unannounced and unprovoked. +

Do I need to get a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign or something? Bailey had to refrain from rolling her eyes. If it was that important Bella could have just texted her or something, there was no need for this social interaction. 8

"Is there a particular reason for your intrusion into my space?" Bailey asked, sitting up. 7

Bella's chocolate brown eyes had an intense gaze. She was silent for a few moments, assembling her thoughts together. Bailey calmly waited but was gradually growing impatient—if Bella didn't have anything to say she could just leave. +

"What do you know about Edward Cullen?" Bella finally spoke. 48

Bailey sat back, resting on the weight of Bella's question. They hardly ever talked to each other and yet interest in some boy is what finally pushed Bella to engage in conversation? Furthermore, she sounded frantic as if she just needed to know more about this mysterious Edward. 1

"Who?" Bailey replied, a bit disappointed that this was the direction in which the conversation was headed. +

"Edward Cullen," Bella repeated herself. "Uh, you know, he has perfect and angular—high cheekbones, a strong jawline, straight nose, and full lips. His hair is kind of messy and retains like an unusual bronze shade. His eyes are dark almost black—" Bella went on and on describing the guy.26

No matter how well she had depicted him Bailey had no clue who she was talking about. She had never heard of the name Edward Cullen and couldn't put a face to the description. Besides, why was Bella asking her about boys? Bailey had never displayed any interest in romantic pursuits before—at least she had never talked to Bella about boys. Why did Bella think Bailey, who had started school at the exact same time, would have more knowledge than her? +

"I haven't the slightest clue who you're talking about," Bailey said. 1

"But I saw you with his siblings." +

"Siblings?" +

"Foster siblings—the Cullen's, from Alaska. Rosalie, Emmett and Alice. I saw you talk to them before you walked away." Bella admitted apprehensively. "I thought that maybe you like befriended them or something?" 7

"You thought that I befriended someone? Me?" Bailey pointed to herself, raising a telling eyebrow at Bella. Now they didn't talk much, but there was no way in hell Bella assumed that Bailey was gallivanting around making friends at school. If that ever happened the only logical explanation would be that Bailey got switched out with an evil clone. +

"Right..." Bella muttered, her desperation had gotten her to lose track of reality for a second there. 1

"Mind if I ask why you're interested in knowing more about this Edward Cullen? Who is he to you?" +

Bella exhaled and began retelling the events that took place in their first Biology class. Bailey was a bit dumbstruck that she hadn't noticed Edward's strange behaviour—the way Bella was explaining the occurrence, Edward's actions appeared a bit excessive. +

"He tried to switch out of the class?" Bailey repeated after Bella when she told her. That was indeed odd. Did he have some sort of vendetta against Bella? Was he just a weird kid? Perhaps there was more at play here? +

Bailey wasn't one for boys or the way they weird conduct themselves but Edward's case was interesting. She was curious to know what he looked like and hoped that once Bella uncovered the rationale behind his previous actions, she would divulge that information to Bailey. 3

⍣ ೋ2

The following day Bella had plans to directly confront Edward about her experience in Biology. Where he had made her extremely uncomfortable and damn near offended her. 2

Bella stood by her truck waiting for Edward to arrive with his family where she would go up to him in this public parking lot. Bailey stayed with her for a few minutes, wanting to see if Bella was really going to go through with it—this rash decision didn't seem like Bella at all, thus igniting Bailey's curiosity. Alas, when the beginning of the first period began to gradually approach Bailey chose to head inside. If Edward did show up she was fairly certain Bella would notify her about it or she would hear about it through the students; word travelled fast in a small school. +

Her morning classes went as to be expected—flawlessly. Although her first period was the outlier. Her history teacher, who still hadn't introduced himself, wasn't keen to find Bailey in the classroom before him. In fact, he had reprimanded her for it. Bailey thought his anger was ridiculous; this interaction only added to her disliking towards the man. This was the first time she had ever had friction with a teacher and it was over nothing! She spent that period in a state of fury as she stare ahead and listened to the teaching—most she already knew. 13

Mr. Hale sat beside her, quiet as ever. Bailey thought it was strange that she knew the names of three of his siblings (courtesy of Bella) and yet still didn't know his. Tinkerbell (Alice) and Goliath (Emmett) bore no resemblance to Mr. Hale and so Bailey could believe the "foster siblings" story. But Goldilocks (Rosalie)? They had some similar features—the same blonde hair, they were both on the taller side and had striking features that made them attractive. 1

In gym class Bailey sat out again still using her period as an excuse—after all, it was an excuse she could use for the next few days. To pass the time she sat in the corner of the gymnasium (the bleachers were getting cleaned at the time) and continued her reading of Order of the Phoenix. 10

At lunch, Bailey did the same as the day before. She went to the library, hiding her food out of the librarian's sight and sitting in a vacated aisle. She enjoyed the silence and her time alone. She felt secure and safe, allowing herself to completely relax as she read her fantastical story. It wasn't that Bailey didn't like her reality, it wasn't that she was actively looking for an escape. She wasn't exactly sure what it was. The concrete reason behind her attachment to this particular series of books. Maybe something had changed in her that she had yet to notice? Maybe she had grown tired of non-fiction novels? Maybe this was some sort of growth, expansion into a whole other side of literature? Or maybe she could just appreciate the writing and the characters? 1

  BAILEY WAS READY TO GO home by the time the final bell rang. When she walked out of class Tinkerbell still had her gold eyes on her—it was the same for the entire period. Did she even pay attention in class or was Bailey her main focus? Did she not realize how creepy she was being? Was she just spacing out? Whatever the reason may have been Bailey would be extremely appreciative if she just stopped, especially considering that she barely blinked. +

She must have dry eyes, Bailey thought arriving at her locker and getting her things. 12

She strode toward the exit with her Order of the Pheonix book in hand. The story was massive and as stated before there were sections that could have easily been edited out or trimmed down a bit. Bailey had only made it to the creation of Dumbledore's Army—a turning point in the story for sure. It was where Harry got to teach his fellow classmates all the defence against the dark arts techniques and spells he knew. Harry really shined in these scenes and in Bailey's opinion she thought that his calling was to be a professor. It seemed to make him truly happy. 14

Bailey walked out of the school doors and paused. It wasn't raining anymore, instead due to the cold temperature the water droplets had frozen into the snow. Bailey looked up at the sky studying the falling white substance. It never snowed in Pheonix and so Bailey wasn't too familiar with how it looked, how it felt. +

Cold, she thought and continued to walk through the parking lot with her nose in her book—stopping for passing cars, maneuvering around groups of students. The cold was different, a unique experience from the warm weather she was so used to. Not that Bailey had many opinions on the weather—she spent most of her time inside anyway so it didn't matter. Rain or shine, cold or warm. 2

Bailey agilely slide across a patch of black ice and arrived at the truck, where she saw that Bella was already there distracted by Edward Cullen. He was standing by his Volvo about four cars down and holding Bella's gaze. Each of them seemed curious and yet uncertain of the other, trying to understand, uncover, the secrets the other kept to themselves—as if they were trying to read each other's minds.+

"How do you do that?" Bella asked Bailey. She had seen Bailey's feats in the corner of her eye. Bella seemed almost amazed at Bailey's practically supernatural ability to remain balanced. +

"It comes with the territory of being a perfect human being." 14

Bella snickered. +

Bailey glanced up from the pages of her book looking at her sister—despite not having much in common, despite not being talkative people, and despite not knowing much about one another they still had these moments of... sisterly bonding. Brief moments that to others would seem pointless and insignificant—but to the Swan family (specifically Charlie, Bailey and Bella) small moments were the foundation of their relationships. 3

"Roads are getting icy, I'll drive slowly," Bella said, reassuring her at her sister who had already gone back to reading. +

Bailey didn't look up from her book, but she had stopped reading. She felt a sudden wave of emotion at Bella's concern. It was as if she already knew Bailey was reading to distract herself from the fact that thirty percent of car accidents occurred on snowy or icy roads. Unfortunately, Bailey couldn't quite place what she was feeling—she couldn't identify the emotion because she hardly ever felt this way. It began to irritate her; Bailey hated being clueless about things, after all, she was an insufferable know-it-all. 11

An odd sound caught both Bailey and Bella's attention. It was a high-pitched screech and it was rapidly becoming painfully loud. Bailey looked away from her page her eyes widened. Her eyes seemed to see everything that was happening around her as adrenaline flowed through her body. +

The sea of faces staring from behind, staring at the sisters with horrified expressions. Among the crowd of people was Edward Cullen also looking on. Bailey located the origin of the noise—a dark blue van that was skidding, tyres locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning widely across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit their truck, and very unluckily Bailey and Bella were standing between them. +

A rush of fear invaded Bailey's body as she blankly stared ahead. Was this it? Was she going to die at fifteen years old without accomplishing anything worthwhile? Her body stood there readily accepting her impending doom, her book dropped from her hands. But before it even hit the ground she heard the sound of the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, followed but the sound of something hard-hitting the ground. It wasn't her though, it was Bella—whose head had smacked against something rather hard. +

Bailey felt chills as something solid and cold had pulled her to the ground. The girls were laying on the pavement. Bailey blinked, her brain operating quickly as it processed what had just happened. Then a voice spoke, a voice Bailey had just heard for the first time that afternoon. +

"Are you girls all right?" Edward Cullen's low voice asked frantically. 19

Bailey looked at him shocked—how had he gotten over to them so quickly? +

"I'm fine," Bella said, her voice sounding strange. She tried to sit up but couldn't because Edward was holding her against the side of his body in an iron grip. 1

"Be careful," he warned as Bella struggled. "I think you hit your head pretty hard." 2

When he brought attention to it Bella was suddenly aware of the throbbing ache—"Ow," she expressed, surprised.

"A hard blow to the head can shake your brain inside the skull. It can potentially result in bruises, broken blood vessels, or nerve damage to the brain," Bailey started saying almost robotically. "A hard hit that doesn't cause bleeding or an opening in the skull could be a closed brain injury. Proper procedure mandates that one should apply firm pressure to the wound with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. But don't apply direct pressure to the wound in case of suspected skull fractures. Watch for changes in breath and alertness. If the person shows no sign of circulation—no breathing, coughing or movement—begin CPR." 41

Bailey's next movements were rigid. She looked at Bella, whom Edward was still holding. She saw that she was alert, responsive and didn't seem to have any severe injuries. +

"Reduce movement... wait for emergency responders... head injuries can go undetected. Hosptial, need a hospital—emergency room, maybe MRI—" +

"Bailey, I'm fine," Bella looked at her sister who looked like she was malfunctioning. Bailey's brain worked faster than ordinary people. Bella was acutely aware that Bailey was going over hundreds—potentially thousands of possible outcomes of Bella hitting her head, including fatality. "Bailey, look at me..." +

"MRIs are helpful if symptoms continue for forty-eight hours or more after injury or if symptoms worsen. No visible injury... but people who suffer from concussions maybe not always exhibit symptoms that are apparent to others," Bailey was rambling under her breath. "Brain bleeding is a possibility... symptoms of bleeding in the brain may gradually worsen or suddenly appear... severe headache, seizures, nausea or repeated vomiting, lethargy—" 31

"Bailey!" Bella said again, louder. "I'm fine. I promise I'm fine." 1

Bailey stared at her with a vacant expression, then began shaking her head. Her mind was still racing. Fine? There were many cases of people being "fine" and then suddenly dropping dead. They needed to get to a hospital, they needed to be sure. Head injuries were no joke—no joke at all. +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            2

  THE MONTH SUCCEEDING THE ACCIDENT was likely the worst time of Bailey's life. She went from spending most of her days alone to having people staring her down at every corner mindful that she was the second Swan's sister and that she had survived a very bad accident. The rest of that week Tyler Crowley had introduced himself and apologized even though Bailey hadn't been injured at all. Regardless, he came to her locker every morning without fail with the same despairing apologies. Luckily, Bailey found escape every lunch in the library where Bella could be the center of attention when she sat at her crowded lunch table. 7

Bailey had the events replaying in her mind for a while. She felt things, emotions she couldn't quite place, couldn't understand. She knew that at first, she was stunned, then scared... but there was more that she wasn't aware of. She had been so preoccupied it caused her to forget to pack a lunch one day. Bailey sat in an empty aisle, her back pressed firmly against an enormous bookcase. She was trying to read to ignore the hunger she felt, trying to ignore the rumblings of her stomach. She could hold out until dinner she was sure of it. 7

Bailey stiffened when a hand appeared beside her. She looked down to her side to find that someone had slipped a blueberry muffin through the opening of the bookshelf. 50

"Mr. Hale?" Bailey blurted out without thinking. 4

He stopped and stared at her from the opposite aisle, his body stiff and unmoving for a while—he looked like a sculpture. +

"Jasper. My name is Jasper." 4

He did not sound like Bailey would have imagined, particularly she was startled by his southern accent. +

Bailey looked at the muffin, her stomach growled but she did not pick it up. +

"Why?" she asked. Jasper raise one of his blond eyebrows and Bailey knew she had to say more—"Why are you offering me food?" 3

"You're hungry, aren't you?" he said as if it were obvious, which it likely was. +

"It would go against my better judgement to take food from a stalker." 13

He cracked a crooked smile. Jasper sat down and leaned his back on the opposite side of the bookcase. The muffin sat between them. They stayed that way for a while, just silently. He did not make any more attempts at small talk, which Bailey appreciated. So after a few minutes, she set down her book, took hold of the muffin and ate it. In the process, she had let her guard down and so Jasper took that chance to ask her a question. 1

"How are you feeling, after the accident?" +

Bailey chewing slowed. She wished that he didn't ask her about it. Everyone always seemed to be asking her about it. What did they expect to hear? Bailey didn't know how to answer them. She didn't know how she felt and it was so frustrating. She found herself clenching her fist. It should have been simple; it was simple for other people to identify how they felt. They could express it so easily that, Bailey was envious of that. 4

"I don't know," Bailey admitted under her breath. Somehow Jasper had heard her. +

"You don't know?" he repeated. +

Bailey stuffed the rest of the muffin in her mouth. Angrily chewing. Yes, she was didn't know. Bailey knew about everything except the interworking of herself. Ask her anything and she would likely know the answer, but when it came to knowing what she was feeling—she fraud. She wasn't clever, not in the slightest... she was clueless. +

"Powerless," Jasper stated. Bailey turned towards him. He was looking off to the side, so she could only see half of his captivating face. He couldn't look older than seventeen or eighteen and yet he had an air of ageless wisdom to him. "I take it you're the type of person who has always felt useful... but at that moment, you became aware of how powerless you truly were. It made you feel insignificant." 5

Bailey blinked and wiped the crumbs from her mouth. Powerless, huh? He was right. For as long as she could remember Bailey was in control of her life; she knew what she wanted she knew that she could get it. She a useful tool to those around her—a golden goose to whichever school she attended (constantly advertised as a genius pupil), a perfect daughter to her mother (never getting into trouble, helping her understand government forms, or doing her taxes); Bailey was even of use to her peers. She began tutoring at the age of seven and had helped many people (some much older than her) achieve their academic goals. 9

Bailey had never been useless before... but when Tyler's van came barrelling towards her there was nothing she could do. She was made aware of her mortality—no matter how many good grades she got, how smart she became at the end of the day she was like everyone else, she was an ordinary human. She could succumb to accidents that were no fault of her own, she could die at any second. She was nothing. 5

"Powerless... yeah," Bailey nodded so deep in thought she hadn't thought to question Jasper on how he had known exactly what she was feeling when she herself did not. 4

⍣ ೋ3

At the end of lunch, Bailey and Jasper departed from the library at different times. Bailey had gotten to her feet and began walking to the exit noticing that Jasper hadn't moved. She couldn't be sure that he had a class after lunch—maybe he had a free period? Maybe that was why he was always in the library during this time? Bailey looked away from him and left the library. +

She stepped into the hallway and was ambushed by someone she did not expect to see. +

"So this is where you disappear to during lunch?" Michael Newton said. He had been leaning against a wall in the hall, but pushed off of it when he spotted Bailey; he approached her. 4

Bailey remained silent. She was still mad at him for what he pulled during this lab assignment in Biology weeks ago. She assumed that he was here looking for an apology and that was something Bailey was not prepared to hand over. She continued walking to her next period, but Michael hadn't left her alone, instead, he walked after her and began walking alongside her. +

"So," Michael dragged, "why don't you eat in the cafeteria?" 2

Bailey did not answer and paid him no mind. +

Michael tried again. "I'm sorry for, you know, for lying"—he let out a humourless chuckle—"Honestly, I'm not even 'mediocre'. I don't get Bs in Bio, I can barely get Cs... I don't know, I guess I was kind of intimidated to be working with you." +

Bailey stopped abruptly, startling him. She inhaled deeply, planted her feet, and turned to face him. +

"You were intimidated by me?" he nodded. Bailey paused.

  THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS FILLED strange happenings. In the morning, Edward Cullen had practically appeared out of nowhere and began conversing with Bella. Bailey thought that they had such a strange relationship if one could even call it that. It was more like a sequence of hot and cold interaction wrapped tightly together with obvious tension. She made sure to scurry off when those two got together, Bailey was no desire in being a third-wheel. +

In History class Mr. Vander (yes Bailey had finally learned his name) was going over the essay he had assigned on the Civil War. Ever since their introduction weeks back Jasper was friendlier in class, that is he didn't ignore Bailey as much; he actually acknowledge her presence. The only reason why he stayed in Bailey's good graces was that he was fairly good a History—not nearly as good as her, but relatively close. 40

Each student was given their essays back. Jasper had received his first and Bailey saw that he'd gotten an A+. When it was Bailey's turn to receive her work from Mr. Vander, he didn't even look at her when he slammed the pages on her desk. +

Bailey picked up her paper and her jaw dropped... a B-, she had gotten a B-. Not an A, not even an A-, hell not even a B! Despite the fact that her writing, research, and analysis were perfect. Bailey was meticulous about writing papers, she had drafts upon drafts, perfecting every detail, every quotation, every argument. 9

She was fuming. She didn't understand what he had against her—these passive-aggressive underminings. Never choosing her when she rose her hand, ignoring her input in class discussions, and now he wasn't giving her the grades that she clearly deserved!  10

"What is this?" Bailey blurted out. +

Mr. Vander stopped handing out the rest of the essays, he looked over at Bailey. "Do you have something to say, Miss Swan?" +

"Yes. I want to know why I'm not getting the grades that I clearly deserve? What is this?" Bailey held up her essay before slamming it back onto her desk. "I don't understand what your vendetta is against me, but as a teacher—a professional, put aside whatever bias you have for me and do your job properly! If my work is flawless give me the flawless grade!" 22

"...Miss Swan, you are so confident that you should deserve a perfect grade—but have you considered that maybe your work isn't as 'flawless' as you claim? But of course, you, a mere student must be more knowledgeable than me. Is that what you're suggesting? Have you been certified by the state of Washington to teach? Have you gotten a bachelor's and masters in History? Two decades of education experience?" 9

Bailey's nostrils were flared but she said nothing. +

"Hmm, yes, I thought not." He had this sickeningly spiteful grin stretched across his face. "Tell me, Miss Swan, do you think that perhaps your unbearable arrogance is compensation for the fact that you aren't as smart as you so deeply believe?" 50

The class had gone quiet. +

No one knew what to say—no one knew which side they were on. It wasn't as if anyone knew Bailey that well, she kept to herself. Sure, she was smart but to blow up at a teacher like that? It did seem a bit arrogant. On the other hand, many thought that Mr. Vander had gone too far. Bailey was the youngest in the class and was now she was currently frozen in her seat staring at the man with a straight face—her eyes quickly filling with tears. 37

Bailey had no retort or response to what Mr. Vander has said. Compensating? He thought that she was compensating? He thought that she wasn't smart? It wasn't even about the paper anymore, it wasn't about the grade—it was about the subtext of what he'd said; he's basically called her an idiot. It was the first time in her life that Bailey had been called an idiot. She... she didn't know what to do. What was she supposed to do? What was the appropriate way to react in this sort of situation? How would anyone else handle it? 25

She sat there overwhelmed, her eyes stinging, tears threatening to fall. But then Bailey exhaled, her face fell, she stared ahead expressionless. Bailey got up from her seat, picked up her paper and began to stride out of the room. 17

"Miss Swan!" Mr. Vander called after her, but she disregarded him and left. +

Bailey spent the rest of the morning hidden away in the library until lunch. She was in the far end of the room, sitting in an aisle that looked practically abandoned. Bailey wasn't even in the mood for reading, instead, she had her knees to her chest, her arms wrapped around her legs and she just stared at the ground. +

"Bailey?" she heard his voice; it was Jasper. 9

Bailey didn't respond, she didn't move; she just stared. +

He sat down in front of her. It was the first time that they had sat in the same aisle since meeting one another—the first time they were talking face to face without a bookcase in the way. Bailey was continuously unresponsive to Jasper's attempts to get her attention. She just sat there staring, motionless—tears uncontrollably streaming down her face. He didn't understand, why was she having such an extensive reaction, especially considering that when he sensed her emotions they weren't too agonizing; Bailey was merely dissatisfied, sad too.12

Jasper reached out to touch her, a wrong move on his part. Bailey immediately flinched away from him. Her eyes became wide and Jasper was struck by her unexpectedly extreme levels of anxiety and distress. She wasn't limp anymore but instead hyperventilating, shaking, and looking around frantically as if she was looking for some sort of escape. 8

He tried to soothe her, tried to change her anxiety for relaxation and her distress to security. But it was almost inconsequential. Each time he thought that he had calmed her down, those same hostile feelings would come back with vengeance. 1

Jasper wasn't quite sure what do to.1

⍣ ೋ3

Jasper had stayed with Bailey in the library for the rest of the day. She hadn't moved at all, she had stopped crying a while ago, he assumed it was because she ran out of tears. Every few minutes he would calm her down, even if it didn't make a difference if he could relieve some of the stress for a moment he was sure she would appreciate it. +

By now he had already called for someone to help, someone who he thought would be more qualified at understanding what was going on. +

"Jasper?" Edward had walked into the library after receiving a call from his brother. He wasn't alone though with him he had Bella Swan, who Jasper had asked him to bring. +

Edward barely had time to assess the situation when he winced at an exceptionally loud voice coming from someone's mind. +

He looked down at Bailey, his eyes widened at the words she was telling herself. The dramatized replaying of what had happened in class. All this internal turmoil, insults she flung at herself, and yet on the outside, she was withdrawn completely. If it hadn't been before her puffy red eyes anyone could have thought she was just zoning out. 6


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            13

  THE ONLY THING BAILEY HAD learned from her time at La Push was that she didn't like any of Bella's friends with the exception of Angela. Also Jacob's ghost story about his tribe. He talked about the tribe being descendants of wolves enemies to the cold ones and how his great-great-grandfather had come into contact with a few cold ones. Supposedly those cold ones were the current Cullens, although the modern-day family had a few additions. It was just a ghost story so Bailey didn't know why it had stuck with her for so long. Vampires didn't exist, werewolves didn't exist either. She was sure the tribe's story had to be a metaphor for, perhaps colonization or something. It shouldn't be taken too seriously. +

Still... still, Bailey had sat in her room that evening with her mind racing. Could it be? She found herself asking. It would explain Edward's abilities during the accident, his speed, his strength. It would explain why Bailey saw Bella shiver when Dr. Cullen touched her. A being that had died couldn't retain body heat. Not to mention the Cullens disappeared when the sun came out—the sun being a popularized weakness of vampires. Likewise, vampires only drank blood and Bailey had never seen Jasper eat during all the lunches they had spent together. He would have food with him, he'd even offer to share... but he never ate any himself. 3

What am I thinking? Bailey shook her head. The existence of vampires went against everything she believed in, science. It was scientifically impossible for vampires to exist, even more so for them to exist without ever being discovered by the rest of civilization. 9

On Monday Bella and Bailey were one of the first ones to school. Mostly because Bella was in such a hurry to get outside—she was in a good mood because it was a nice day outside again and she wanted to make the most of it. Bailey barely had time to finish her bowl of cereal when Bella dragged her out of the house and practically stuffed her in the truck. Bella had decided to stay outside on one of the benches, deep in thought while Bailey went inside. Since it was earlier Bailey decided to head to the library for a little research project—looking into vampires. +

"This is ridiculous," Bailey whispered to herself. Disappointed that she was even considering the possibility that the Cullens and the Hales could be vampires. +

"Hey," Mike Newton whispered, pulling up a seat next to Bailey who currently sat alone at one of the library tables. +

Bailey didn't greet him. +

"I saw Bella and she said you'd already gone inside, I figured I could find you here." receiving no response Mike continued. "Not a fan of the sun or something? Even at the beach, I noticed you were sort of closer to the shade." +

"Pardon me for following the necessary preventative measures to protect myself from contracting skin cancer," she said looking at him with scornful eyes. +

A grin stretched across his face. The tidy spikes of his hair shone golden in the sunlight that came through the library windows. He was staring at her closely, Bailey leaned back when he unexpectedly leaned a bit closer to her. +

"Sorry. I just never noticed before—you have a bit of green in your eyes." He commented. 16

"It's called central heterochromia. Rather than having a single distinctive eye colour, central heterochromia results in a different colour near the border of the pupil. In my case, it's a shade of green around the border of my pupil while the rest of my iris is blue." Bailey explained to him, looking away because he was staring too intensely into her eyes. "I suppose I can understand your interest—it's a rather rare condition with an incidence of just zero point zero-five percent." 60

"Cool," Mike said although he wasn't exactly interested in the technicality of it all—he just thought she had cool eyes. "So what did you do yesterday?" +

"I finalized my Powerpoint presentation on the intergenerational trauma and the origins of systemic racism after the abolishment of slavery in 1865. I also studied for my AP Calculus test coming up at the end of the week. Afterwards, I proofread Bella's English essay on whether Shakespeare's treatment of his female characters is misogynistic—oh, then I spent working with a few clients," Bailey relayed, finishing with a satisfied nod. 22

How she had tackled so many things in one day, Mike had no clue—moreover, he was staring at her as if she had just spoken pig Latin. +

"Yeah, I totally forgot that we had an essay." Mike was in the same English class as Bella. "I'll have to get to work on that tonight, which sucks 'cause I was going to ask if you wanted to go out tonight." +

"Go... outside?" Bailey said feigning cluelessness. +

"No, like hanging out together, the two of us," Mike corrected, smiling at her hopefully. +

Bailey exhaled. "Michael... Allow me to be as straightforward as possible. I don't like you. I find you very uncomfortable and I don't like being around you. You constantly pop up out of nowhere, you talk to me all the time, you invade my personal space and I don't like that—so just stop." 61

Mike's face had fallen. "W-Well, that's only 'cause you're always alone. I was just trying to be friendly..."  14

"I see," Bailey nodded. She shut the book on vampires she was reading and got to her feet. "Stop that too." 49

She left him there sitting alone and befuddled. +

The rest of the day passed rather slowly. In History class they had a substitute again. Bailey found that Jasper was absent, but was reminded that the Cullens were always a way when it was sunny. For a moment her mind had gone back to her foolish suspicions—that he was away because of the sun; he was hiding away from his one weakness. But Bailey put the thought aside as she sat down. It was preposterous—it had to be... 2

That same evening Bailey was alerted to an alleged Port Angeles shopping trip that was happening with Bella's friends. Jessica and Angela (no Lauren because she had prior engagements) were interested in buying dresses for the spring dance and invited Bella to come—even though she wouldn't be attending the dance. Bailey looked up from her book when Bella asked her to come. Bailey was almost certain that her sense of style wouldn't fit Jessica or Angela, but she was charmed at the idea of shopping especially considering that she had gotten paid on Sunday. +

"I'll come," Bailey cut Bella off mid-sentence. She had been putting on a large speech trying to convince Bailey that it would just be the girls, no Mike. Regarding Mike, after Bailey's rejection, he had asked Jessica to the dance which had prompted Jessica's enthusiasm toward the venture. 1

Excitement wasn't the right word to describe how Bailey get about getting out of town. She wasn't giddy or anxious. She wasn't going for Jessica or Angela—she couldn't care less about their dresses. Bailey was going for herself, it was like going to the grocery store only she wasn't planning on buying groceries. She needed a new charger, maybe some new winter boots, glasses cleaning, and headphones for work. 6

  JESSICA AND ANGELA DIDN'T SEEM mind Bella and Bailey's disappearance when they noticed Edward Cullen with them. Bella had called out to them, waving at the girls. They rushed over, the pronounced relief on their faces simultaneously changing to surprise when they had spotted him. It was so shocking they hesitated a few feet away from the unlikely trio. 1

"Where have you been?" Jessica's voice was suspicious. +

 "I got us lost," Bella admitted sheepishly. "And then we ran into Edward." She gestured toward him. +

"Would it be all right if I joined you?" he asked—his voice silken and irresistible to the teenage girls he stood with, Bailey being the exception. Instead of fawning over Edward unleashing his "talents" upon them, her eyes glued to the restaurant and a hand resting on her growling stomach. +

"Er... sure," Jessica breathed. +

"Um, actually, Bella, we already ate while we were waiting—sorry," Angela confessed. 3

"That's fine—I'm not hung—" Bella was cut off by Bailey's stomach letting out a thunderous growl. The youngest member of the group had all eyes falling upon her as she continued to stare at the restaurant. Any longer and she'd contemplate devouring the entire establishment. 14

"Seems that's decided. Bella, I think you should also eat something." Edward's voice was low, but full of authority. He looked up at Jessica and spoke slightly louder. "Do you mind if I drive Bella and Bailey home tonight? That way you won't have to wait until they eat." +

"Uh, no problem, I guess..." She bit her lip, trying to figure out from Bella's expression whether that was what she wanted. +

Bella winked at her. She wanted nothing more than to be (relatively) alone with her perpetual savour. After all, there were so many questions that she couldn't bombard him with till they were by themselves. +

"Okay," Angela was quicker than Jessica. "See you tomorrow, Bella, Bailey... Edward." She grabbed Jessica's hand and pulled her toward the car. 6

As they got in, Jessica turned and waved, her face eager with curiosity. Bella waved back, waiting for them to drive away before she turned to Bailey. +

"Let's go," she said.+

The restaurant wasn't crowded—it was the off-season in Port Angeles. The host was female and Bailey found it quite annoying when she spent most of her time assessing Edward instead of seating them immediately. She was several inches taller than either Swan sister and unnaturally blonde. +

"A table for three?" Edward said, his eyes flicking to Bailey who was mentally uttering as many curses as she could at the woman who took her sweet time while also glancing around the restaurant pausing at ever open the table they could be seated at right now. +

Bella was surprised by how much the hostess's behaviour bothered her. She noticed the hostess's eyes flicker to her then away, satisfied by Bella's obvious ordinariness, and by the cautious, no-contact space Edward kept between them. She led the trio to a table big enough for four in the center of the most crowded area on the dining floor. +

Bailey stared at the table uncomfortably. Did it have to be here? Why when there was so much space? She looked away in time to see Edward smoothly hand the hostess a time as he insisted, "Perhaps something more private?" +

"Sure." She sounded surprised. She turned and led them around a partition to a small ring of booths—all of them empty. "How's this?" +

"Perfect." He flashed her his gleaming smile, dazing her momentarily. +

"Um"—she shook her head, blinking—"your server will be right out." She walked away unsteadily. +

"You really shouldn't do that to people," Bella criticized. "It's hardly fair." +

"Do what?" +

"Dazzle them like that—she's probably hyperventilating in the kitchen right now." +

Edward seemed confused. +

"Oh, come on," Bella said dubiously. "You have to know the effect you have on people." +

He titled his head to one side, and his eyes were curious. "I dazzle people?" +

"You haven't noticed? Do you think everybody gets their way so easily?" +

He ignored her questions. "Do I dazzle you?" +

"Frequently, in fact," Bailey answered for Bella, her eyes reading over the menu. "It's part of the reason she's so enamoured with you. She's never been dazzled by a boy of your calibre before. I believe it's triggered something primal or hormonal, perhaps a bit of both. Either way, it's ignited this almost stalker-like obsession—" 35

Bella reached over and covered Bailey's mouth before she could continue, her face actively reddening. She couldn't even look at Edward knowing good and well what his expression might look like. Honoured? Maybe a bit smug?+

"Hello. My name is Amber, and I'll be your server tonight. What can I get you." The Swans immediately noticed she was only speaking to him. 1

"I'll have a virgin strawberry mojito," Bailey said closing the drinks menu and exchanging it for the meals. 13

Edward looked at Bella. +

"I'll have a Coke." It sounded like a question. +

"Two Cokes and one virgin strawberry mojito," he said. 2

"I'll be right back with that," she assured him with another unnecessary smile. But he didn't see it. He was looking at Bella. +

"We come to a restaurant with a three-page drink menu and you decide to order Cokes? You can get a can of Coke for a dollar at the corner store. Here they're three dollars and some change. You need to manage your money better, Bella," Bailey said, apparently not noticing the intense staring match happening between Bella and Edward. Or maybe she did notice and she chose not to care. +

"I'm sure I won't miss a couple of dollars," Bella replied. +

Before Bailey had the chance to argue her statement out came a question from Edward. "How are you feeling?" he asked. +

"I'm fine," Bella replied, surprised by his intensity.+

"You don't feel dizzy, sick, cold...?"+

"Should I?" +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            1

︵‿︵‿︵‿︵+

  NORMALCY HAD CEASED TO EXIST in their lives. At least, that was Bailey's takeaway. How could she possibly act as if everything was normal when her entire belief system had been derailed? Vampires were real. The Cullens and Hales were vampires; immoral beings that traversed the earth feasting on human beings. That is until they decided upon their "vegetarian" diet. Perhaps the worse thing to come of this discovery was the enthusiasm that grew between Bella and Edward. They were no longer "hiding" their relationship—or lack thereof. Bailey was fairly certain they hadn't officially changed their relationship status, but they might as well have. Edward kept showing up every morning for the next few days to drive the sisters to school. Coincidentally, he started doing this when the truck was having some problems, but Bailey kept her suspicions to herself. 5

Edward and Bella were spending every waking moment together. On top of driving them to school, he was walking Bella to class, sitting with her at lunch at a completely separate table from the rest of his family, then driving them home in the afternoon. Unsurprisingly, having Edward Cullen driving them every day in his shiny, silver Volvo caught the attention of the entire school much to Bailey's despair. Each morning she jumped out of the car, kept her face hidden behind whichever book she was reading that day and ignored the stares she received. 3

"Does that hurt?" Bailey asked him. She was sitting in the library for lunch as she normally did. In front of her was Jasper Hale with his hand held out toward her. 3

Bailey had just pricked his finger with a thumbtack—it didn't appear to puncture his skin though. While Bella and Edward were getting closer romantically, Bailey was becoming increasingly infatuated with the inner workings of the vampire physique and its capabilities. Jasper had quickly become Bailey's test subject. 37

"No," Jasper answered watching carefully as Bailey inspected his white hand. +

With every experiment, he noticed that she grew more comfortable around him. Maybe this was her way of familiarizing herself with people? While others would ask personal questions like "what's your favourite colour" Bailey instead pulled out a stethoscope and listened for if you had a heartbeat. 7

"So you don't have blood, instead your veins are filled with venom that has the ability to transform humans into vampires. But you don't have a heartbeat to spread said venom around your body, so how—" Bailey chewed on her lip as she jotted down her findings in her notebook. "Then again blood circulation is essential for the purpose of supplying the body's vital organs with enough oxygen and nutrients needed to operate. You're technically dead there wouldn't be any need for your organs to function. Still, that wouldn't explain why you have the necessity to drink blood. Where does the blood go? Does your body absorb it? Maybe it has something to do with your venom? Or perhaps—"+

"You're taking this fairly well," Jasper spoke, his southern accent slipping through, "better than I would have expected." +

"... Does it seem that way?" Bailey asked, her voice extremely low barely a whisper. "I'm trying. I'm not like Bella. Her capacity to just accept Edward without any doubt, inquiries... I can't do that. Does that make me strange? Abnormal?" +

"It makes you different than Bella. It makes you, you." Jasper assured. 21

Bailey blinked, slowly looking up at him to see that he was already staring at her. She held their peaceful eye contact for a few moments before looking away, dropping his hand. Bailey picked up her notebook and pencil, leaned against the bookcase and spread her legs out in front of her. +

"How does the thirst for blood work?" she asked. Bailey had her eyes on her notes but could feel that Jasper was still staring at her. "Does the intensity disappear upon consumption? Or is it a constant feeling that just fades? Could you, say, survive on a single drop or is there a certain amount you have to intake to feel satisfied? If virtually nothing kills you, would you die if you were incapable to drink blood?" +

Jasper paused, taking a moment to try and answer all of her questions adequately. "My apologies if I can't answer all your questions," he began softly. "Thirsting for blood isn't quite the same feeling as hunger, though rather similar. I'd say it is more like discomfort and pain perhaps? Once the feeling is satisfied the thirst does go away for about two weeks before gradually returning. From my understanding our thirst for blood isn't for survival—we can't die of starvation, but we get physically weaker as the thirst intensifies. The more intense the thirst, the more insane we become." 3

Bailey was writing down everything he said. +

"Edward said animal blood is like tofu. I've never had tofu but I know it has been a staple in Japan and East Asia for quite some time, along with becoming increasingly popular in the West. Though if that were the case wouldn't drinking animal blood be more popular in your... community?" she asked. 1

"Yes, well, human blood is far more"—he stiffened—"appetizing. Even though when drinking animal blood we receive the same... nutrition, it doesn't quench the thirst as well as human blood."12

Bailey nodded taking note that Jasper had stopped moving altogether again (he seemed to do that a lot); he looked like a perfectly made sculpture.  +

"And you have an innate characteristic to desire human blood specifically? Edward said that for some of you the transition was rather difficult." +

Jasper was quiet for a long while but Bailey was patient, there was no need to rush anything. +

"He was talking about me. In our family, I'm the newest to our special diet." +

"When did you become a 'vegetarian'?" +

"1948, shortly after Alice found me and brought us to the Cullens." 4

Bailey nodded. 1948 seemed like quite some time to get used to animal blood unless, of course, he'd spent more time devouring humans. +

"When did you become a vampire?" +

"1863." 6

A hundred and forty-two years? Bailey's eyes widened a little bit. Jasper had been a vampire for over a century but had only been a vegetarian for fifty-seven years. His struggle with his new lifestyle was understandable. Bailey grew more curious but wasn't sure what questions to ask first or what was appropriate to ask so she hesitate. The sharpened granite of her pencil hovered just above the page. 1

"If controlling your thirst is so difficult then why did you approach me that day?" Bailey asked calmly. "Edward fled to Alaska because he almost killed Bella. Am I not as appetizing? If so should I take offence to that or be grateful?" 8

"There are instances where the smell of some human's blood is intensely mouthwatering compared to others. They're called blood singers."1

"Bella is Edward's blood singer?" +

  BAILEY ONLY FOLLOWED JASPER TO give Bella and Edward some privacy. Bailey was led to another section in the house, and neither of them spoke until they entered the room. Bailey lingered, looking down at a table where rested a readily made chessboard. She stared at it trying to figure out what he was wanted to accomplish—were they going to play to see if she forgave him? Was this his way of telling his side of the story? Bailey couldn't be sure, but she allowed her curiosity to direct her subsequent decisions. She approached one side of the table, sat down and Jasper sat across from her. Their game began soon thereafter. One move at a time, no words exchanged, the tick-tocking of the clock drowning out the silence. 3

"I was seventeen," Jasper said. Bailey didn't look up from the chessboard. "My father thought that it was about time I become a man. He'd been a veteran himself, and believed there was no greater honour than to fight for one's country." +

"The Confederacy fought for state rights, against the United States," Bailey murmured, moving her knight. 4

"To my father, the Confederacy was the only 'country' that mattered." +

"Did you—did your family own slaves?"+

"No," Jasper's response was genuine, his face hardened. "But I knew people who did. I was raised to believe it was normal. I understand it's no excuse for my conduct, but I was a product of my environment. That all changed when I became a vampire." 35

"Because you met Alice?" Bailey assumed. "Was she able to see the evolution that happened in the future? Humanity's progression?" +

"Although Alice did help me a lot, it was Maria who first showed me a different way." +

"Maria? The vampire that changed you?" 1

Jasper nodded. "She changed many people into vampires after me, building an army for herself. I, with my military experience, was her greatest prize. I helped with the troops, showed them how to use their new abilities, direct their thirst. I'm sure you can guess who were the primary victims of our appetite." +

"... Confederate soldiers?" 2

"Yes. Now I am incapable of changing the past or erasing my actions. But I can control the person that I am today and who I will become in the future. If society can change from what it was back then to the world today, shouldn't we believe that people can change as well? That I can change?"  he asked softly. 8

Bailey tapped her fingers against the table. She could feel her anger, her disappointment fading—but she knew it wasn't Jasper at work this time. These were her authentic emotions. Would forgiveness be the right thing to do? There was no excuse for Jasper's past but Bailey should at least acknowledge this growth as a person—vampire. He could have kept the same sentiments, the same prejudices. Instead, he had changed, he'd learned. He'd seen the world evolve, he could sense the emotions of those in oppression now... that had to have genuinely given him some sort of enlightenment. +

"I suppose," Bailey finally said, moving her next piece and staring Jasper in the eye. "Also, checkmate." +

Jasper glanced down at the chessboard. Bailey had in fact beaten him, and in less than three minutes too. He had been playing chess for over a century and yet she had defeated him so effortlessly. Jasper hadn't thought about it too much before, but as he looked back up at Bailey seeing her looking down at the chessboard... she was concentrating again. Why? He wondered.  He saw Bailey's eyes flickering to each of her pieces then back to his own and he seemingly understood. 3

Is she going through other possible playthroughs in her head? Jasper thought, watching her silently. It was almost terrifying how smart she was. 8

"Bailey?" he said, trying to regain her attention before she got too far into her head. +

"Hm?" Bailey acknowledged but didn't remove her eyes from the chessboard. She felt as though she had taken too long. Two minutes and thirty-nine seconds—that's how long it took her to beat Jasper. +

Jasper hesitated with his next words. He could feel that her anger had subsidized, she was relatively calm at the moment—did that mean he was forgiven? +

"Can I have a sample of your venom?"  6

Jasper's gold eyes gazed at her.+

"My... venom?" +

"I'd like to observe it under a microscope and run some tests—" Bailey paused, "—hm, I'm going to need a few samples with everything that I have in mind." +

"A few?" +

"Yes, a few dozen to start. Depending on what I discover I may need more. I'm to assume that there isn't a limit to how much venom you can generate? It's not as if someone can, say, drain you of it, right?" Bailey asked him. +

"I-I don't think anyone has ever tried, so I'm not sure how to answer that," Jasper admitted, worried about the ideas that Bailey might be getting into her head. +

"Could I try to drain you?" Bailey asked, earnestly. "Since you aren't human it wouldn't be considered human experimentation. Also, your vampire physiology makes it so you have a much higher pain tolerance; I doubt anything I'd do would harm you that much. Unless of course, you're interested in uncovering the limitations of your pain tolerance—" 8

"I'd gather that stay a mystery," Jasper cut her off quickly. Bailey had already taken out her notebook and was jotting down experiment ideas. "Bailey, I would appreciate not being experimented on." 1

Bailey stopped writing—"Can I still have the venom samples?"+

"... Sure." +

"Also a finger." 49

"What?" 1

She looked in his general direction. "It's for scientific purposes and you'll heal just like when I pricked you before. Speaking of, how is can your body regenerate cells if said cells are frozen? Do they unfreeze when you're injured? Or does your venom produce new cells? Are those cells human cells? Or are they vampire cells? Is there such thing as vampire cells?"6

"Uh," Jasper blinked. 1

He tried to answer her questions to the best of his capabilities but he didn't know the answer to all of them. He'd never really questioned how he functioned on a molecular level. No one ever did—no one except Bailey Swan that is. 2

Bailey and Jasper have rejoined Alice after a while—her disappearance had raised some questions with Bailey but she didn't get the chance to ask them, she had other priorities. Jasper seemed relieved that Bailey has turned her questioning to Alice, mostly focusing on Alice's ability to see the future. She had gone from Biology to physics in a matter of seconds trying to explain Alice's abilities by gathering whatever knowledge she could from things she had learned and read about theoretical physics. +

  BAILEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY INTEREST in baseball. Not that she was attending tonight for the game itself. She was going for her samples of vampire venom and only her samples. Bailey was twinkling with excitement. She wondered what it looked like, its properties and its undiscovered abilities. Everything about this was groundbreaking and she could hardly contain herself!16

"Aren't you going to get cold?" Bella asked Bailey. Bailey had entered the kitchen to fill her water bottle while Bella was on the phone with Jessica. Jessica was rather eager to inform Bella that Mike had finally kissed her that afternoon. +

Bailey looked down at her clothes, they clearly didn't retain any warmth. She walked to the fridge and reached inside for some cold water. +

"If it gets too cold I'll stay in the car." +

"You'll waste all my gas." +

"I'll pay you back," Bailey replied. She filled her metal bottle. "You're well aware that I can." +

Bella fell silent. She still wasn't used to the fact that Bailey had over six figures in her bank account. "Right," she murmured. 17

At that moment, the front door slammed and they could hear Charlie banging around under the stairs, putting his tackle away. +

"Hi there, girls!" Charlie called as he walked into the kitchen. Bella waved at him and Bailey nodded. +

"See ya, Jess." Bella hung up the phone. "Hey, Dad." he was scrubbing his hands in the sink. "Where's the fish?" +

"I put it out in the freezer." +

"I'll go grab a few pieces before they freeze—Billy dropped off some of Harry Clearwater's fish fry this afternoon." Bella worked to sound enthusiastic. +

"He did?" Charlie's eyes lit up. "That's my favourite."+

Charlie cleaned up while Bella got dinner ready. Bailey drank a bit of her water, before refilling it and taking a seat at the table. It didn't take long till they were all sitting at the table, eating in silence. Charlie was enjoying his food. +

"What did you two do with yourselves today?" he asked. +

"Well, this afternoon I just hung out around the house..." Bella tried to keep her voice upbeat. +

Bailey swallowed the fish she had chewed. "This morning Bella and I went over to the Cullens'." +

Charlie dropped his fork. +

"Dr. Cullen's place?" he asked in astonishment. +

Bella pretended not to notice his reaction. "Yeah." +

"What were you doing there?" He hadn't picked his fork back up.+

"Well, I sort of have a date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents... Dad?" +

It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm.+

"Dad, are you all right?" +

"You are going out with Edward Cullen?" he thundered. +

Uh-oh—Bella thought to herself. "I thought you liked the Cullens." +

"He's too old for you," he ranted. +

"We're both juniors," Bella corrected, though he was more right than he dreamed. 1

"Bailey's also a junior and she's fifteen." Charlie paused, looking at his youngest who was the only one still eating. "You're not dating are you?" 1

"No." +

"Good. Then what were you doing over there?" +

Bailey's eating slowed and she recalled their phone call—"Apparently I'm friends with Jasper Hale." +

"Which one is that?" +

"The blonde one, male twin," Bailey explained. +

"When did this happen? He's way too old." +

"We're in the same history class," Bailey said indifferently. "And he already has a girlfriend." 24

That didn't seem to soothe Charlie but was just enough to put a pin in that conversation as he turned to his eldest daughter. "Which one is Edwin?" 20

"Edward is the youngest, the one with the reddish-brown hair." The beautiful one, the godlike one... Bella kept those descriptions to herself. +

"Oh, well, that's" —he struggled— "better, I guess. I don't like the look of that big one. I'm sure he's a nice boy and all, but he looks too... mature for you. Is this Edwin your boyfriend?" +

"It's Edward, Dad."+

"Is he?" +

"Sort of, I guess." +

"You said last night that you weren't interested in any of the boys in town." But he picked up his fork again, so the worst had to be over. +

"Well, Edward doesn't live in town, Dad." +

He gave Bella a disparaging look as he chewed. +

"And, anyway," Bella continued, "it's kind of at an early stage, you know. Don't embarrass me with all the boyfriend talk, okay?" +

"When is he coming over?" +

"He'll be here in a few minutes." +

"Where is he taking you?" +

Bella groaned loudly. "I hope you're getting the Spanish Inquisition out of your system now. We're going to play baseball with his family." +

Charlie's face puckered, and then he finally chuckled. "You're playing baseball? Both of you?" +

"Well, we'll probably watch most of the time." +

"You must really like this guy," he observed suspiciously. +

Bella sighed and rolled her eyes for his benefit. +

They heard the roar of an engine pull up in front of the house. Bella jumped up and started cleaning her dishes. +

"Leave the dishes, I can do them tonight. You baby me too much." 5

The doorbell rang, and Charlie stalked off to answer it. Bella was a half step behind him. Bailey looked around the now-vacated table, she could hear how outside it was pouring rain now. She stood up, wondering where she had placed her umbrella. +

"Come on in, Edward." 1

Bella breathed a sigh of relief when Charlie got his name right. +

"Thank, Chief Swan," Edward said in a respectful voice. +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                            3

  WHEN THEY EMERGED FROM THE forest one by one Bailey could immediately see the disparities between these strangers and the Cullens. The walk of the three nomads was catlike, a pace that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into a crouch. They dressed in ordinary gear of backpackers; jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. Their clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. One man had long hair in dark locs, the other man had medium-length ashy blonde hair in a low ponytail, and the woman's brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into a more casual erect bearing. 4

The man in front was easily the most beautiful. He was of medium build, smooth-porcelain like dark skin, hard muscles, of course, but nothing to Emmett's brawn. 3

He smiled an effortless smile, exposing a flash of gleaming white teeth. +

The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose group around Bailey and Bella, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly feline. The second man hovered inconspicuously behind them, slimmer than the leader. His eyes were completely still and seemed the most vigilant. 3

Their eyes were different, too. Bailey noted that they were not gold or black that she had unconsciously expected, but a deep burgundy colour that was more sinister. +

The dark-skinned man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle. +

"We thought we heard a game," he said in a relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. "I'm Laurent, these are Victoria and James." He gestured to the vampires beside him. +

"I'm Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward, Bella and Bailey." He pointed them out in groups deliberately not calling attention to individuals. +

Bella and Bailey? Bailey repeated in her mind. She had not taken her eyes off the vampires but was surprised that Carlisle had included her and Bella in his listing. +

"Do you have room for a few more players?" Laurent asked sociably. +

Carlisle matched Laurent's friendly tone. "Actually, we were just finishing up. But we'd certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long?" +

"We're headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighbourhood. We haven't run into any company in a long time." +

"No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves." +

Bailey observed the changes in everyone's body language—relaxing of shoulders, smiles that were beginning to stretch across faces. The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into casual conversation; Bailey attributed this to Jasper using his particular gift to control the current situation. +

"What's your hunting range?" Laurent casually inquired. +

Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. "The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep permanent residence nearby. There's another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali." +

Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. +

"Permanent? How do you manage that?" There was honest curiosity in his voice. +

"Why don't you come back to our come with us and we can talk comfortably?" Carlisle invited. "It's a rather long story." 2

James and Victoria exchanged a look of surprise at the mention of the word "home", but Laurent controlled his expression better. +

"That sounds very interesting and welcoming." His smile was gracious. "We've been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven't had the chance to clean up in a while." His eyes moved appreciatively over to Carlisle's refined appearance. 4

"Please don't take offence, but we'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from hunting this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand," Carlisle explained.+

"Of course," Laurent nodded. "We certainly won't encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway," he laughed. Bailey's grip on herself tightened. +

"We'll show you the way if you'd like to run with us—Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward, Bella and Bailey to get the jeep," he casually added.+

Three things happened simultaneously while Carlisle was talking. Bailey uncrossed her arms just as a light breeze went brushing her exploded arms, and catching Bella's hair. Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, analyzing the human sisters, his nostrils flaring. +

A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched on step forward into a crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defence, a feral snarl ripping from his throat. +

Bailey's eyes widened at the sight. This was unquestionably a display of feral behaviour. Up until now the vampires (other than some physical differences) were so human-like but now some cracks were forming in their perfect exterior. Human response to a threat would be this wild and aggressive, animalistic—it was a rather intriguing discovery, that Bailey couldn't enjoy at the moment because her life was being threatened. +

"What's this?" Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. +

Bailey jumped when Bella graze her arm while moving protectively in front of her. 5

"The girls are with us." Carlisle's firm rebuff was directed toward James. +

Laurent seemed to catch their scent less powerfully than James, still, awareness now dawned on his face. Bailey was barely able to see them with Bella standing directly in front of her. +

"You brought a snack?" he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. +

Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. +

Bailey thought it resembled a predator protecting his prey from a scavenger. Defensive but not exactly out of intimacy but rather... survival? Possessiveness? +

Laurent stepped back again. +

"I said, they're with us," Carlisle corrected in a hard voice. +

"But they're human," Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. +


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

︵‿︵‿︵‿︵8

  THEY HAD HURRIED BACK TO the Cullen house and things persisted at an instantaneous pace. Esme and a reluctant Rosalie swapped clothes with Bella and Bailey and would take their truck to try and get James off the scent. Carlisle, Emmett, and Edward turned their sights on James—hunting the hunter. Bailey remained silent, sitting in a corner of the room eyeing everyone else who seemed to be readying themselves. She pressed her hands together with her mind racing, her emotions confusing with how much they fluctuated at increased intervals. +

"Alice," Carlisle asked, "will they take the bait?" +

Everyone watched Alice as she closed her eyes and became incredibly still. +

Finally, her eyes opened. "He'll track you. The woman will follow the truck. We should be able to leave after that." Her voice was certain. +

"Let's go." Carlisle began to walk toward the kitchen. +

Bailey watched Edward approach Bella. She observed their closeness, the iron grip Edward had on Bella and her willingness to the touch. Then for the shortest second, his lips were pressed hard against hers. Bailey looked away then in time to see Jasper take a seat beside her. +

"Jasper," Bailey whispered out watching as Cullens started disappearing before her eyes. "Tell me something, what am I feeling?" +

"A few things all mixed together," he told her vaguely. +

Bailey looked at him awaiting a proper answer. +

"Scared, powerless, regretful, and very, very murderous." 4

Bailey nodded slowly looking away from him. "I don't believe it's classified as 'murder' if technically the victim is already dead." +

Jasper was on his feet at that. He held out his hand, Bailey took it and as easily as Emmett had before, Jasper lifted her in his arms, shielding her protectively. 25

"Leave the sins to us damned souls." 3

"Damned?" Bailey questioned but received no response as they flew out of the room with them was Alice carrying Bella. +

⍣ ೋ3

The hotel room was bland, the bedside lamps were bolted to the tables, the long drapes were made from the same fabric as the bedspread, and the generic watercolour prints on the walls were tacky in Bailey's opinion. She remembered the voyage here. The sleek black car, the glass in the windows darker than that of a limousine. The engine was almost silent, though they'd raced across the black freeways at more than twice the legal speed. Alice was sitting with Bella on the dark leather backseat, Bailey in the passenger as Jasper had his eyes fixated on the road. Bailey recalled looking back during the long night, Bella's head had ended up against Alice's granite neck. The front of her thin cotton shirt was damp with the tears that streamed from Bella's eyes until they were red and sore. +

Bailey hardly got any sleep; her aching eyes strained open even though the night finally ended and dawn broke over the low peak somewhere in California. The gray light, streaking across the cloudless sky, stung her eyes. Bailey didn't close them, she had passed the time reading books and fantasizing about James' gruesome death. It was odd, she'd never actively hated someone so much before. It was an interesting experience and a new sensation. +

She was still awake when they came through a shallow mountain pass and the sun, behind them now, reflected off the tiled rooftops of the Valley of the Sun. They had made a three-day journey into one. Bailey raised her eyes from her book pages and stared blankly at the wide, flat expanse laid out in front of her. +

Phoenix—the palm trees, the scrubby creosote, the haphazard lines of the intersecting freeways, the green swaths of golf courses and turquoise splotches of swimming pools, all submerged in a thin smog and embraced by the short, rocky ridges that weren't big enough to be called mountains. +

"Which way to the airport?" Jasper had asked. Bailey noticed Bella flinch in the rear-view mirror, though Jasper's voice was quite soft and un-alarming. +

"Stay on the I-ten," Bailey instructed. "We'll pass by it." +

"Are we flying somewhere?" Bella had asked Alice. +

"No, but it's better to be close, just in case." +

They had done a loop around Sky Harbour International before settling on this hotel room. This awful hotel room where Bailey had gotten even less sleep. She hated the feel of the hotel sheets, and the mattress was uncomfortable as well. So instead, she had done more reading, patiently waiting for some good news—news like the death of James. So that she could go back home and return to the life she had grown so accustomed to. 5

It was dark outside. The digital clock on the nightstand wrote three o'clock (in the morning). She got up from her seat and made her way to the bathroom. Bailey turned on the lights to look at herself; she was visibly fatigued. There were still dried tear stains on her cheeks from when she had been crying excessively, bags were starting to form under her eyes from the lack of sleep, her hair was a mess, and to top it all off she was still wearing Rosalie's clothes. The clothes didn't fit right, as Rosalie was much taller than her, they weren't Bailey's style either. Bailey preferred muted tones, browns, dark greens and blacks. She wasn't too keen on the expensive fabric either. Bailey was more grunge with her look with some hints of goth. 12

She turned on the tap water and splashed her face with cold water. She repeated this a few times until her face was slightly numb before turning the water off. She looked at herself again, water dripping from her jawline and eyelashes. Flashes of the last few days played through her head and Bailey gripped the sink tightly. +

"Are you okay?" his voice came from the doorway, the door which Bailey hadn't closed. +

She looked over at him, Jasper, and saw that he had a towel in hand. Bailey reached out for it and used it to dry her face as she walked past him. +

"Define 'okay'." +

Jasper sighed. "Then let me rephrase. What are you thinking?" +

"Many things cross my mind daily, I won't have the time or energy to recount everything," Bailey responded distantly. +

"You haven't slept and you're not eating or drinking..."+

"I haven't shut down. I'm still in control," Bailey said, intentionally referring to Bella who had been a mess since their whole escapade had started. +

"I'm still concerned. Besides, it's not about control," Jasper paused, "it's about letting yourself feel." +

"Emotions cloud judgment. Anything could happen at the moment, nothing is for certain. We have yet to receive a call from Carlisle or Edward or whomever. Shouldn't that be your concern?"   +

  DEATH WASN'T PEACEFUL LIKE HER books had made seem. Instead, it hurt a lot and was relatively uncomfortable. There wasn't any white light, no warm welcoming ambiance, no visions of dead relatives calling out to her, and no big breaded man meeting her big pearly white gates. Instead, it was dark, it was quiet... so unbelievably quiet and unfamiliar. 2

"Not yet, Bailey." an unfamiliar voice whispered. "Not yet." +

"Do I know you?" Bailey asked the voice, seemingly floating in this endless void of nothingness.+

"You will..." 63

Bailey opened her eyes to bright light. She was in an unfamiliar room, a white room. The wall beside her was covered in long vertical blinds; over her head, the glaring lights blinded her. She was propped up on a hard, uneven bed—a bed with rails. The pillows were flat and lumpy. There was a continuous beeping sound somewhere close by. +

She opened and closed her dry mouth trying to moisturize it with some saliva as she spoke. "'The difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits.' Albert Einstein." 14

"Bailey?" it was Bella. She was sitting beside Bailey's bedside. Her eyes were puffy and red from consistent crying. "Bailey!" she threw her arms around her sister and the crying began again. +

Bailey stiffened up at the sudden physical contact. Her eyes were wide as she blinked, allowing Bella her few seconds before wiggling away highly uncomfortable. +

"I thought you would never wake up again. It was too close... too close..." she sniffled. +

"We were almost too late," this time Edward had spoken. Bailey wasn't surprised to see him. Wherever Bella was, he was sure to follow. "We almost didn't get to you one time." +

"I calculated your arrival time using the speed which I saw during the baseball game and the distance of the airport to the dance studio. It's was all based on rough estimation but I was right in the end; I'm always right." Bailey nodded, proud of her accomplishments. 23

"You shouldn't be happy about this!" Bella scolded. Her sadness turned to anger very quickly. "You were reckless! You could have died!" +

"That was a possibility yes. But it's like you said, we couldn't be guarded forever. I weighed the alternatives and chose the best course of action. You make it seem as though deciding to die was an easy task; it involved hours of self-reflection. I almost didn't do it." Bailey admitted. "Anyway, I was only mirroring your own actions. At least I had a carefully planned out strategy. You, Bella, went in there blindly without any sort of preparation!" 4

"I—" +

"He had you all tricked, just like I thought he would. You were all concerned that he was coming after Bella and I, concerned for the humans... idiots. Edward, you said it yourself that he thought of this all as a game, and yet none of you even thought to play along? To understand your opponent? We were never the targets. He admitted that much. He wanted thrill, he wanted excitement, he wanted a challenge—he wanted Edward's fury. I just played his game better than him." 14

"You could have died..." Bella repeated. "And I couldn't do anything to stop it." +

Bailey looked at her expressionlessly. "You could have died. And you refused to let me do anything to stop it." 1

Apparently, Bailey was an absolutely miracle because despite being in such a disastrous explosion the damage was minimal in compassion. She had been unconscious for a few weeks, but her recovery was smooth. She had broken ribs, a punctured lung, burns on her hands from shielding her face from the explosion, a deep gash on her upper thigh that had been the source of most of her bleeding, all paired with a broken arm. +

Bailey was looking over her chart, reviewing everything that had been done to her while she was unconscious. Bella and Edward had gone out to announce to the others that she had finally woken up. +

"You blew up a building!" Jasper charged into the room. 49

Bailey didn't look up from her chart. "Well, it seemed like the only way to—" +

"You—blew—up—a—building!" he repeated looking at her as if she was insane. 21

Bailey blinked, she looked away from her chart and at him with a blank face. Silence crept into the room before Jasper rubbed his face and calmed down. +

"Why didn't you just tell Alice and me that Bella was going to sneak away?" 5

"He would have run away the second he saw that Bella wasn't alone. Her scent is more overpowering than mine so I could conceal my presence better. Also, he had an obsession with Edward and thought Bella was his ticket to that. He was proud, gloating about his accomplishments. I was virtually undetectable." +

"But the whole building?" Jasper sighed. There was now nothing left of the studio, it had been burned to the ground and the news channels were covering it as a rise in criminal activity in the area. 3

"Vampires have strong durability. I couldn't just use my taser on him. I thought that if the building exploded he'd at least have some trouble getting away and by then you and Alice, maybe even the others would have arrived." Bailey looked away. "I remembered that the studio was mainly powered by gas because one time when I was six we had to evacuate because there was a leak. It's a really old building, the foundations were probably weak and rotten. I also had my taser. I just needed to make some modifications to it so it would go off when I wanted it to. That part was easy and I did it on the ride to the studio. Once that was all set up I just needed a way for the gas to spread through the whole building. Luckily it's spring in Arizona, the ventilation system was most likely still on. When he started talking, monologuing like a cliche, it was more than enough time for the gas to disperse. That only left one thing: getting Bella out of harm's way and so—" 2

"You sacrificed yourself," Jasper concluded for her. +

Bailey nodded. "This year has made it abundantly clear to me that Bella is protective of me. Spinning the narrative to my favour was a simple task. Once I assured him he would get a vengeful Edward, I had him in the palm of my hand. It worked out better than I expected. I didn't think he would get impaled through the neck like that or burn so quickly." 1

"Fire is a vampire's weakness. To kill us you have to rip off the head and burn the body." +

"Good to know. I'll write that down later." 1

"Listen, Bailey, what you did," Jasper moved closer, "it was really, undeniably stupid. When I saw... when I saw your body lying there in those huge flames, in a pool of your own blood. I just—" 12

"I'm not going to apologize," Bailey interrupted him. "James is dead. The threat was neutralized. I survived. Everything went even better than I had anticipated. I'm not going to apologize for doing something a group of vampires couldn't." 81


                                
                            
                              
                                  
                              
                              
                                
                                  
                                  
                                
                              
                             
                          

︵‿︵‿︵‿︵1

  BAILEY THOUGHT THAT HE WAS absolutely deranged. She had already planned on how she intended to spend the night; she was going to be locked away in her room, revisiting the mountain of notes she had accumulated and then studying her findings so far. Bailey didn't want to socialize, she didn't want to be around loud music, sweaty teenagers, flickering lights—it all sounded traumatizing. But she had been tricked, duped into going over to the Cullen house because Jasper had said he finally had her venom samples ready. He even told her that his family had added an entire laboratory to their house just for her so she could experiment in peace. 10

Bailey had trusted him, she had put her faith in him and instead, he had betrayed her. 9

"Stop standing like that," Alice said while adjusting Bailey's dress. +

Bailey stood stiffly, her shoulders raised as her eyes shifted around the room uncomfortably. This wasn't a laboratory. It was Alice's room, basically a dressing room. Bailey was getting dolled up as if she were a barbie doll and she knew the exact reason why—prom. 2

"Refusing to let me go home classifies this whole thing as kidnapping," Bailey muttered. +

"Hush," Alice giggled happily. She was having too much fun with this whole thing. "Okay, done!" +

Bailey stepped forward as Alice moved away. She looked over at the full-length mirror to her right and saw her reflection. Her hair was straightened and in a 90s inspired blowout that gave it ridiculous volume, her makeup was done so that her eyes were dark (dark shadow, black eyeliner with a sharp wing) and yet she had a light-tone lip. Her dress was made of a light material, nothing too heavy and more on the airy side so she wouldn't get too hot. To go along with everything, she had black, fingerless gloves made of lace. Her heels were also black and the strappy kind that had the strap wrap around her leg up until reached her knee. Bailey blinked a few times as she examined her appearance.2

"Tell me you love it," Alice was smiling proudly. The ensemble screamed Bailey, she had done a very good job. 3

"I suppose it could have been a lot worse," Bailey admitted. She liked the look, but she didn't like where she was going to be wearing it. "But I won't be needing it." +

"Aw, you have to go, Bailey. I know Jasper really wants you to." +

"Why?" Bailey grumbled. +

"Because he's graduating and he wants you to make some more friends," Alice explained. +

"Why can't he mind his own business?" Bailey's tone wasn't meant to be rude. She was stating a fact. It wasn't Jasper's place to try and force her to make friends. She didn't need nor did she want his help with that.3

Alice ignored her comment. "Come on, Bella and Edward are waiting." 1

Bailey knew she had no choice in the matter. She couldn't run away even if she wanted to, after all, vampires were much faster than her and she didn't know how to run in heels. She followed Alice through the Cullen house down the stairs and to the garage where Bella and Edward were by his car waiting and Jasper was off to the side giving them some space. Emmett and Rosalie had already gone ahead; Rosalie still didn't like them. 7

 Bailey eyed fixated on something Jasper hand in his hand. +

"Okay, okay, she's ready!" Alice announced bouncing into the room and gathering the attention. 3

Bailey looked positively unamused when eyes fell on her. She ignored Bella's compliments, didn't take kindly to Edward's smile, and stared down at Jasper when he approached her. 3

"Here you go," Jasper handed her what had been in his hand. On closer inspection, Bailey saw that it was a white rose corsage. She stared at it for a long while then looked back at Jasper with dull eyes. He just smiled, dismissing her lack of enthusiasm and putting the "gift" on her wrist. 11

Bailey managed to be distracted by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from his pocket inside his jacket, looked briefly at the caller ID before answering. +

"Hello, Charlie," he said warily. 1

"Charlie?" Bella frowned. +

Charlie had been very stern since their return back to Forks. While Bailey had come up with a perfectly good excuse for her behaviour Bella had not. So, Charlie had compartmentalized Bella's bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle, he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault—because, if not for him, they wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. 1

These days Bella had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews... visiting hours. While Bailey was basking in the glory of being the favourite child. 8

Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. 1

"You're kidding!" He laughed. +

"What is it?" Bella demanded. +

He ignored her. "Why don't you let me talk to him," Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited a few seconds. "Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen." His voice was very friendly, on the surface, but the soft edge of menace was easy to catch. 7

Bailey's eyebrow rose briefly. What was Tyler doing at their house?  +

"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight." Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly more evident as he continued. "To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offence. And I'm sorry about your evening." 3

He didn't sound sorry at all as he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. +

Bella's face and neck flushed crimson with anger. She could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill her eyes. 2

Bailey looked at her bewildered by this emotional demonstration—why was she crying? +

Edward also looked at her in surprise. "Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you." +

Bella ignored that. "You're taking me to the prom?" she yelled. +

Bailey blinked. Had Bella not realized that this entire time? It was embarrassingly obvious. 1

"You just realized that?" Bailey was genuinely shocked by Bella's lack of observational skills. Had she not seen the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings? Why did she think Alice had gotten them all dressed up? Not to mention Jasper's corsage, the tuxedos he and Edward were wearing. 2

Edward pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. "Don't be difficult, Bella." +

"Why are you doing this to me?" She demanded in horror. 2

She followed Alice through the Cullen house down the stairs and to the garage where Bella and Edward were by his car waiting and Jasper was off to the side giving them some space. Emmett and Rosalie had already gone ahead; Rosalie still didn't like them. 7

 Bailey eyed fixated on something Jasper hand in his hand. +

"Okay, okay, she's ready!" Alice announced bouncing into the room and gathering the attention. 3

Bailey looked positively unamused when eyes fell on her. She ignored Bella's compliments, didn't take kindly to Edward's smile, and stared down at Jasper when he approached her. 3

"Here you go," Jasper handed her what had been in his hand. On closer inspection, Bailey saw that it was a white rose corsage. She stared at it for a long while then looked back at Jasper with dull eyes. He just smiled, dismissing her lack of enthusiasm and putting the "gift" on her wrist. 11

Bailey managed to be distracted by the sound of a phone ringing. Edward pulled his cell phone from his pocket inside his jacket, looked briefly at the caller ID before answering. +

"Hello, Charlie," he said warily. 1

"Charlie?" Bella frowned. +

Charlie had been very stern since their return back to Forks. While Bailey had come up with a perfectly good excuse for her behaviour Bella had not. So, Charlie had compartmentalized Bella's bad experience into two defined reactions. Toward Carlisle, he was almost worshipfully grateful. On the other hand, he was stubbornly convinced that Edward was at fault—because, if not for him, they wouldn't have left home in the first place. And Edward was far from disagreeing with him. 1

These days Bella had rules that hadn't existed before: curfews... visiting hours. While Bailey was basking in the glory of being the favourite child. 8

Something Charlie was saying made Edward's eyes widen in disbelief, and then a grin spread across his face. 1

"You're kidding!" He laughed. +

"What is it?" Bella demanded. +

He ignored her. "Why don't you let me talk to him," Edward suggested with evident pleasure. He waited a few seconds. "Hello, Tyler, this is Edward Cullen." His voice was very friendly, on the surface, but the soft edge of menace was easy to catch. 7

Bailey's eyebrow rose briefly. What was Tyler doing at their house?  +

"I'm sorry if there's been some kind of miscommunication, but Bella is unavailable tonight." Edward's tone changed, and the threat in his voice was suddenly more evident as he continued. "To be perfectly honest, she'll be unavailable every night, as far as anyone besides myself is concerned. No offence. And I'm sorry about your evening." 3

He didn't sound sorry at all as he snapped the phone shut, a huge smirk on his face. +

Bella's face and neck flushed crimson with anger. She could feel the rage-induced tears starting to fill her eyes. 2

Bailey looked at her bewildered by this emotional demonstration—why was she crying? +

Edward also looked at her in surprise. "Was that last part a bit too much? I didn't mean to offend you." +

Bella ignored that. "You're taking me to the prom?" she yelled. +

Bailey blinked. Had Bella not realized that this entire time? It was embarrassingly obvious. 1

"You just realized that?" Bailey was genuinely shocked by Bella's lack of observational skills. Had she not seen the date on the posters that decorated the school buildings? Why did she think Alice had gotten them all dressed up? Not to mention Jasper's corsage, the tuxedos he and Edward were wearing. 2

Edward pressed his lips together and his eyes narrowed. "Don't be difficult, Bella." +

"Why are you doing this to me?" She demanded in horror. 2
